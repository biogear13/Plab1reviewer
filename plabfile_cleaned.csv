[it is estimated that adults secrete 75-150mg of cortisol in response to major surgery and 50mg a day for minor surgery, and secretion parallels duration and extent of surgery patients undergoing a surgical procedure or responding to stress, trauma, or an acute illness will exhibit an increase in adrenal cortisol production up to 6-fold normal levels. however, in patients on chronic exogenous steroid therapy, atrophy of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis may occur through feedback inhibition, leading to an inability to respond to stress. it has historically been believed that patients receiving long-term corticosteroids require supplemental, perioperative doses, and that failure to provide such coverage in secondary adrenal insufficiency may lead to an adrenal crisis characterized by hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. *** so who are telling remove dexamethason are wrong!!!*** patients receiving “physiologic replacement” doses (<10 mg/ day) do not need additional steroids perioperatively beyond their standard regimen. patients receiving doses exceeding the normal expected stress response for their surgery (>150 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for moderate/major surgery, or >50 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for minor surgery) also do not need additional coverage beyond their current therapy, because acute immunosuppressive doses are more than sufficient to maintain cardiovascular stability during the operation. regular daily dose of more than 10 mg prednisolone within the last three months: i)	minor surgery:		25 mg hydrocortisone at induction ii)	moderate surgery		usual pre-operative steroids (hysterectomy)		+ 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction + 100 mg hydrocortisone/day  iii)	major surgery		usual pre-operative steroids major trauma, prolonged 	+ 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction surgery 			+ 100 mg hydrocortisone/day for 2 – 3 days  surgical patients commonly develop hyperglycemia related to the hypermetabolic stress response, which increases glucose production and causes insulin resistance. although hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes, the treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin infusions has not provided consistent benefits. despite early results, which suggested decreased mortality and other advantages of “tight” glucose control, later investigations found no benefit or increased mortality when hyperglycemia was aggressively treated with insulin. because of these conflicting data, the optimal glucose concentration to improve outcomes in critically ill patients is unknown. there is agreement, however, that hypoglycemia is an undesirable complication of intensive insulin therapy and should be avoided. so, “for perioperative hyperglycemia no need of insulin” just iv saline!!!].",,

1571. a 70yo man presents with a fluctuant swelling of the scrotum which feels like worms when he is standing but regresses when he lies down. what is the most probable dx?,a. varicocele,b. hematocele,c. testicular ca,d. epidydimal cyst,e. saphena varix,,,,,,,chat: the most probable diagnosis for the man in the question is varicocele. the key is the presence of fluctuant swelling of the scrotum which feels like worms and regresses when he lies down which are all suggestive of varicocele. a varicocele is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum. it is similar to a varicose vein that can occur in your leg.,ans: a
"1572. a 52yo woman has had a swelling in the neck, hoarseness and stridor-both inspiratory and expiratory for 2m. what is the most probable dx?",a. ca larynx,b. ca thyroid,c. vocal chord nodules,d. ca bronchus,e. thyrotoxicosis,,,,,,,"chat: the most probable diagnosis for the woman in the question is ca thyroid. the key is the presence of swelling in the neck, hoarseness and stridor-both inspiratory and expiratory which are all indicative of ca thyroid1. a goiter is the medical term for a swelling of the thyroid gland2. it sits at the front of the neck and produces hormones that help regulate metabolism2. a goiter does not always cause symptoms. however, possible symptoms include: a tight feeling in the neck, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing and breathing1.",ans: b
"1573. a woman became acutely sob in the recovery bay and is coughing after ga. auscultation: reduced air entry at the right lung base and diffuse wheeze. observation: hr=88bpm, bp=112/76mmhg, temp=37.8c and sat=91% in air. choose among the options which c-section complication has she developed?",a. aspiration pneumonitis,b. spontaneous pneumothorax,c. endometritis,d. pulmonary embolism,e. tension pneumothorax,,,,,,,"chat: the woman in the question has developed aspiration pneumonitis. the key is the presence of diffuse wheeze, reduced air entry at lung base and raised temperature which are all indicative of aspiration pneumonitis1. aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury after aspiration of gastric contents2. it can lead to serious illness or even death2.",ans: a
1574. a 23yo female presents with paresthesias and loss of distal pulses in her arms. she is noted to be hypertensive. she describes feeling unwell a month prior with fever and night sweats. what is the most probable dx?,a. kawasaki disease,b. takayasu arteritis,c. buerger’s disease,d. embolism,e. raynaud’s phenomenon,,,,,,,"chat: takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the aorta and its branches, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion. the clinical manifestations can vary depending on the site and severity of the arterial involvement, but common symptoms include hypertension, diminished or absent pulses, and neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias or stroke-like symptoms. kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that primarily affects children, whereas buerger's disease is a non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disease of the peripheral arteries that is typically associated with smoking. embolism and raynaud's phenomenon are also unrelated to the symptoms described in the question.",ans: b
1575. a 35yo woman presents with mass in the groin. exam: mass found just below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. there is no cough impulse and it is irreducible. what is the most probable dx?,a. direct inguinal hernia,b. strangulated hernia,c. femoral hernia,d. saphenavarix,e. femoral aneurysm,,,,,,,"chat: a femoral hernia presents as a bulge in the groin below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. unlike an inguinal hernia, there is no cough impulse, and the hernia is often irreducible. strangulation is a potential complication of femoral hernias and can lead to bowel obstruction or ischemia. saphenavarix is a dilated vein in the leg and is not associated with a groin mass. a femoral aneurysm is a rare entity and is usually asymptomatic.",ans: c
"1576. a 30yo woman has injured her left lower chest in a rta. she has bp=80/50mmhg, pulse=120bpm. auscultation of chest=bowel sounds present. what is the single most likely dx?",a. diaphragmatic rupture,b. flail chest,c. fx ribs,d. ruptured esophagus,e. tension pneumothorax,,,,,,,"chat: the key is a. diaphragmatic rupture. [bowel sound present on auscultation of chest following rta causing lower chest injury is suggestive of diaphragmatic rupture]. it's important to note that bowel sounds on chest auscultation are not specific for diaphragmatic rupture and can also occur with other conditions such as diaphragmatic hernia or bowel perforation. however, in the given scenario, the mechanism of injury and the presence of hypotension and tachycardia make diaphragmatic rupture the most likely diagnosis.",ans: a
1577. a lady presents with a swelling below the groin crease that can be reduced. there is no med hx of note. what is the most probable dx?,a. inguinal hernia,b. strangulated hernia,c. testicular tumor,d. epidydimal cyst,e. femoral hernia,,,,,,,"chat: a femoral hernia is the most probable diagnosis as it is a swelling below the groin crease that can be reduced. inguinal hernias are also a possibility, but they are more commonly found above the groin crease. strangulated hernias would cause pain, tenderness, and possibly vomiting, and require urgent intervention. testicular tumors and epididymal cysts would present as scrotal swellings rather than groin swellings.",ans: e
"1578. a 32yo woman of 38wks ga attends the antenatal day unit with pain in the suprapubic area that radiates to the upper thighs and perineum. it is worse on walking. her urine dipstick showed a trace of protein but no white cells, nitrates or blood. what’s the most likely dx?",a. braxton hicks contractions,b. round ligament stretching,c. symphasis pubis dysfunction,d. labor,e. complicated femoral hernia,,,,,,,"chat: the symptoms described are typical of symphysis pubis dysfunction, which can occur during pregnancy due to hormonal changes and increased pressure on the pelvic joints. the other options are less likely, as braxton hicks contractions usually do not cause significant pain, round ligament stretching typically presents with sharp pain on one side of the lower abdomen, labor pain is usually more intense and associated with contractions, and a complicated femoral hernia would typically present with a visible bulge in the groin area.",ans: c
"1579.  a 45yo mechanic presents with a reducible swelling in the groin, impulse on coughing is present. he has mild dragging pain in the abdomen, otherwise he’s normal. what is the best management strategy?",a. truss,b. elective herniorrhaphy,c. urgent herniorrhaphy,d. elective herniotomy,e. reassure,,,,,,,"chat: you are correct that the most appropriate management strategy for a 45-year-old man with a reducible groin swelling and cough impulse is elective herniorrhaphy (choice b). this is because there is a risk of complications with hernias, such as incarceration and strangulation, which can be life-threatening. a truss (choice a) is not recommended for long-term management of a hernia and should only be used as a temporary measure. urgent herniorrhaphy (choice c) is only necessary in cases of irreducibility or strangulation. elective herniotomy (choice d) is not recommended in older patients due to the high risk of recurrence. reassurance (choice e) is not appropriate in this case as the patient has a potentially serious condition that requires treatment.",ans: b
"1580. a 25yo man present with a mass in the groin after heavy lifting. exam: mass is found just above and medial to the pubic tubercle. it is reducible. on applying pressure on the internal ring, cough impulse is still present. what is the most likely dx?",a. direct inguinal hernia,b. indirect inguinal hernia,c. femoral hernia,d. strangulated hernia,e. femoral aneurysm,,,,,,,"chat: the key is b. indirect inguinal hernia. [on applying pressure on the internal ring, cough impulse should disappear in a normal person, which indicates that the internal ring is closed. if there is still a cough impulse, it suggests the presence of a hernia. in this case, the fact that the mass is reducible and above and medial to the pubic tubercle indicates an indirect inguinal hernia]. a direct inguinal hernia usually occurs in older patients and is due to a defect in the transversalis fascia. it typically presents as a bulge in the medial aspect of the inguinal canal and does not usually produce a cough impulse. a femoral hernia presents as a bulge in the upper thigh just below the inguinal ligament and is more common in women. it typically does not produce a cough impulse. a strangulated hernia is a complication of an incarcerated hernia, where the blood supply to the herniated tissue is compromised, leading to ischemia and necrosis. this is a surgical emergency. a femoral aneurysm is a rare condition and would present as a pulsatile mass in the femoral region.",ans: b
"1581. a 35yo woman presents with a swelling in the neck. the swelling has increased in size gradually over the last two years and the patient feels she has difficulty with breathing. exam: mass measures 8cm by 10 cm, soft and not warm to touch. it moves with deglutition. which is the most appropriate management of this mass?",a. partial thyroidectomy,b. oral thyroxine,c. oral propylthiouracil,d. excision biopsy,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is a. partial thyroidectomy. [gradually increased swelling in the neck which moves with deglutition is thyroid enlargement and as it is causing pressure symptom like difficulty in breathing a partial thyroidectomy should be performed]. it's important to note that the presented information does not provide a definitive diagnosis, and further evaluation and testing may be necessary before deciding on a management plan. however, assuming the mass is related to the thyroid gland, a partial thyroidectomy may be appropriate to relieve pressure symptoms while preserving thyroid function. option b (oral thyroxine) is not appropriate as it is a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism, while option c (oral propylthiouracil) is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, which may not be indicated in this case. option d (excision biopsy) may be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain and a tissue sample is needed for further evaluation.",ans: a
1582. a 46yo laborer reports swelling in the right groin. the non-painful swelling is observable in both the erect and the recumbent positions. exam: non-tender irreducible 4 cm mass in the right groin below and on the medial side of the inguinal ligament. which is the most likely dx in this pt?,a. indirect inguinal hernia,b. femoral hernia,c. saphenous vein varicocoele,d. hydrocoele,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is c. saphenous vein varicocele. this is a wrong key! correct key is b. femoral hernia. [sephanous vein varicocele is readily reducible with recumbent position. so presented case is not sephanavarix. usual location of femoral hernia is below and lateral to pubic tubercle but it is not absolute and it is possible for femoral hernia to present as mass below and medial to pubic tubercle. so the presented case is a case of femoral hernia]. femoral hernia. the presentation of a non-tender, irreducible mass in the right groin, below and on the medial side of the inguinal ligament, is consistent with a femoral hernia. saphenous vein varicocele typically presents as a reducible mass and can be differentiated from a hernia by the presence of a pulse in the mass. indirect inguinal hernias typically present as a swelling in the inguinal canal and are more common in men. hydroceles present as a painless swelling in the scrotum.",ans: b
"1583. a camel rider sustained a kick to the lateral side of his right leg just below the knee caused by the camel stick. the site is slightly bruised and tender to touch. during physical examination, he is unable to either dorsiflex or evert the foot. there is loss of sensation over the front and outer half of the leg and dorsum of the foot. if these observations are the result of damage to a nerve bundle, which is the most likely nerve affected?",a. lateral popliteal,b. peroneal,c. tibia,d. sural,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is b. peroneal. [inability of dorsiflex and foot eversion with sensory loss over front and outer half of leg and dorsum of foot are seen in peroneal nerve injury]. peroneal nerve injury can cause weakness or paralysis of the muscles involved in dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, as well as sensory loss over the affected area. the other options are less likely to be affected in this specific case.",ans: b
"1584. a 46yo woman presents with sudden episode of abdominal pain which started about 2h ago. the pain is located in the epigastrium and radiates to her back. she has vomited twice since the onset of attack. the pain is made worse by lying flat on her back and she is more comfortable sitting up and bending forwards. she was informed of the presence of gallstones in her gall bladder four weeks earlier when she reported pain in the right hypochondrium. the oral temp=39c, bp=120/80mmhg and the radial pulse=118/min. there is no jaundice but there is marked tenderness in the epigastrium both on deep and superficial palpations. which is the most appropriate inv for the cause of the patient’s pain?",a. plain abdominal x-ray,b. serum amylase,c. serum bilirubin,d. barium swallow,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is b. serum amylase. [epigastric pain radiating to back, worse on lying flat and comfort on bending forward are classic presentation of acute pancreatitis in which serum amylase is increased]. the symptoms are suggestive of acute pancreatitis, and serum amylase is a commonly used test to diagnose this condition. a plain abdominal x-ray or barium swallow would not be useful in this case, and serum bilirubin levels may be elevated in some cases of pancreatitis, but it is not the most appropriate initial investigation.",ans: b
1585. a 75yo japanese woman reports repeated episodes of vomiting of undigested food mixed with blood. she has lost 5 kgs in weight over the last one month. clinical exam: shows a frail woman with mild conjuctival palor. exam: non-tender slightly mobile mass in the epigastric region. which is the most likely dx?,a. colon cancer,b. gastric cancer,c. gall bladder cancer,d. oesophageal cancer,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is b. gastric cancer. [non-tender mass in epigastrium, conjunctival pallor (anemia), weight loss, vomiting of undigested food mixed with blood due to pyloric obstruction by cancer mass and particularly japanese (highest incidence of gastric cancer due to taking smoked fish) are suggestive of gastric cancer]. colon cancer would typically present with altered bowel habits and rectal bleeding, while gallbladder cancer would typically present with right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. esophageal cancer would typically present with dysphagia and weight loss.",ans: b
"1586.   a 45yo man, known to be chronically addicted to alcohol, presents in the ed and reports two episodes of vomiting fresh bright red blood in the previous 6h. he estimated the volume blood vomited at each bout to be more than 500mls. clinical exam: the radial pulse=120/min, bp=90/60mmhg. there is no mass or tenderness in the epigastrium. the liver is palpable for 3 cm below the costal margin and not tender. the patient is not jaundiced. the physician resuscitates the patient with oxygen by face mask, rapid infusion of intravenous normal saline while he requests for haemoglobin level and whole blood for transfusion. which is next appropriate step in management?",a. barium swallow,b. exploratory laparotomy,c. ct scan of the abdomen,d. upper gastrointestinal endoscopy,,,,,,,,"chat: upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient, as it will allow for visualization and diagnosis of the source of bleeding. option a, barium swallow, would not be appropriate as it is not sensitive enough to identify the source of active bleeding. option b, exploratory laparotomy, would not be appropriate as it is an invasive procedure and should be reserved for unstable patients or those who do not respond to initial resuscitation measures. option c, ct scan of the abdomen, may be helpful in some cases, but it is not as accurate as endoscopy in identifying the source of bleeding.",ans: d
1587. a 42yo woman reports to the surgeon that she is worried about a lump that she feels the right breast. the surgeon observes a 2 cm by 3 cm mass in the right lower quadrant of the breast. there are no associated skin changes and the mass has limited mobility. there is no discharge from the nipple. there is no axillary lymph node enlargement. examination of the left breast and axilla was completely normal. a mammogram report suggests the presence of microcalcifications. which is the most appropriate next step in the management of this pt?,a. observation for one year and repeat the mammography,b. a needle-guided biopsy of the breast,c. excision biopsy of the breast,d. partial mastectomy,,,,,,,,"chat: the presence of a solid mass and microcalcifications on mammogram raise concern for malignancy. a needle-guided biopsy of the breast is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and plan further management. observation or repeat mammography would delay diagnosis and treatment if malignancy is present. excision biopsy or partial mastectomy may be considered for definitive treatment, depending on the biopsy results.",ans: b
1588. a 45yo man presents with a mass on the right side of the face. the mass was first observed three months ago but has recently become visibly larger. he feels pain over the mass and is unable to blow a whistle. clinical examination shows that the mass is likely to be the parotid gland. an oral examination shows a foul smelling discharge from the duct of the gland and gentle probing shows that it is stenosed at the meatus. which of the following features suggests that the mass might be malignant?,a. presence of pain,b. recent enlargement,c. facial nerve palsy,d. stenosed duct meatus,,,,,,,,"chat: facial nerve palsy is the most concerning feature in this scenario and suggests the mass may be malignant. the parotid gland is innervated by the facial nerve, so if the tumor involves the nerve, it could cause facial nerve palsy. the presence of pain, recent enlargement, and stenosed duct meatus are not specific features of malignancy and can be seen in benign tumors as well. however, the foul-smelling discharge from the duct is concerning and could suggest an infection, which would need to be treated.",ans: c
1589.  a 6yo boy presents with jaundice following treatment with sulphathiazole. investigations suggest that the jaundice is due to haemolysis caused by g6dp deficiency. which is true regarding etiology of g6dp deficiency?,a. inherited as autosomal dominant condition,b. inherited as sex-linked dominant condition,c. inherited as sex-linked recessive condition,d. results from auto-antibodies to red cell antigens,,,,,,,,"chat: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency is an x-linked recessive genetic disorder that leads to hemolytic anemia due to the inability of red blood cells to detoxify reactive oxygen species. the gene responsible for this enzyme is located on the x chromosome, so males are more frequently affected than females. the deficiency is inherited as a recessive condition, meaning that both copies of the gene must be affected to cause the disease. option a is incorrect because g6pd deficiency is not inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. option b is incorrect because g6pd deficiency is not an x-linked dominant condition. option d is incorrect because g6pd deficiency is not caused by auto-antibodies to red cell antigens.",ans: c
"1590. a 5yo previously healthy child has a 1-day history of severe pain in the throat, breathing difficulties and fever. on examination you find an anxious, septic-looking child with drooling of saliva and stridor. which is the most appropriate initial management?",a. intubation under general anaesthesia,b. insertion of nasogastric tube,c. fluid resuscitation and antibiotics iv,d. anteroposterior & lateral neck x-ray,,,,,,,,"chat: i agree with the answer. acute epiglottitis is a medical emergency that can cause rapid airway obstruction and respiratory arrest. intubation under general anesthesia is the most appropriate initial management to secure the airway and prevent further complications. option b (insertion of nasogastric tube) is not the correct management for acute epiglottitis and may exacerbate the airway obstruction. option c (fluid resuscitation and antibiotics iv) is important in the management of acute epiglottitis, but it should not delay the urgent need for airway protection. option d (anteroposterior & lateral neck x-ray) is not necessary for the initial management of acute epiglottitis and may delay critical interventions.",ans: a
1591. a 6yo boy has been noticed to have problems with co-ordinating his voluntary movements over the last two years. he has a waddling gait and needs to support himself on his hands when rising from the floor. he has larger calves than other boys but he runs more slowly. which is the most likely dx?,a. myotonia,b. myasthenia gravis,c. duchenne muscular dystrophy,d. muscular atrophy,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is c. duchenne muscular dystrophy. [the child having difficulty with walking, running, jumping and climbing stairs. walking may look different with a 'waddling' type of walk. the boy may be late in starting to walk (although many children without dmd also walk late). when you pick the child up, you may feel as if he 'slips through your hands', due to looseness of the muscles around the shoulder. the calf muscles may look bulky, although they are not strong. as he gets older, the child may use his hands to help him get up, looking as if he is 'climbing up his legs'. this is called 'gower's sign']. duchenne muscular dystrophy is an x-linked recessive condition that predominantly affects boys. it is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, starting with the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. the child's symptoms of difficulty in coordinating voluntary movements, a waddling gait, and needing to support himself on his hands when rising from the floor are indicative of muscle weakness. the larger calves but slower running are consistent with the pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles that is characteristic of duchenne muscular dystrophy. myotonia (a delay in muscle relaxation after contraction) is characteristic of myotonic dystrophy, which is not the likely diagnosis based on the child's symptoms. myasthenia gravis is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with use and improves with rest, and muscular atrophy is a nonspecific term that describes a decrease in muscle size and function.",ans: c
"1592. a previously healthy, 10m female child presents to your clinic with a 1-day history of high fever, runny nose and conjunctivitis. the child looks unwell and is irritable. exam: child's oropharynx shows that it is inflammed and there are small white spots on the oral mucosa. which is the most likely dx?",a. kawasaki disease,b. parvovirus infection,c. herpes zoster,d. measles,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is d. measles. [koplick’s spots are characteristic of measles]. just to add, kawasaki disease typically presents with prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, but it does not typically present with white spots on the oral mucosa. parvovirus infection can cause a rash, but it does not typically cause inflammation of the oropharynx or white spots on the oral mucosa. herpes zoster typically presents with a painful rash in a dermatomal distribution, and it is uncommon in infants.",ans: d
"1593. a 3d term, breast-fed infant is brought by the mother who reports that the child has not been active and not feeding well. she also notices jaundice, which was not present at birth and is increasing. exam: the temp=35.4°c, and the liver is palpable 2 cm below the costal margin. which is the most likely dx?",a. rhesus isoimmunisation,b. inadequate breast milk,c. congenital biliary tract obstruction.,d. sepsis,,,,,,,,"chat: newborns are at risk of developing sepsis due to their immature immune system, and the symptoms described in the question are consistent with sepsis. rhesus isoimmunisation is a potential cause of neonatal jaundice, but would not explain the other symptoms. inadequate breast milk and congenital biliary tract obstruction would not cause the symptoms described in the question.",ans: d
"1594. a 65yo woman with dm, htn and normal kidney function underwent a total right hip replacement. she had massive haemorrhage during the operation and was given 8 units of packed rbc. the blood pressure dropped to 60/40 mm hg for about two hours before it was corrected with blood transfusion. two days after the surgery the serum creatinine level rose to 4.2 mg/dl (normal <1.5 mg/dl), bun was 50 mg/dl (normal 10-20 mg/dl) and potassium 5.0 mmol/l (normal 3.5-5.0 mmol/l). there were brown granular casts in the urine sediment. which is the most likely cause of this complication?",a. diabetic nephropathy,b. malignant hypertension,c. acute tubular necrosis,d. interstitial nephritis,,,,,,,,"chat: acute tubular necrosis (atn) is a common cause of acute kidney injury and is often due to ischemia caused by decreased blood flow or hypotension, which can occur during surgery or other procedures. in this case, the massive hemorrhage and hypotension during the hip replacement surgery likely contributed to the development of atn. brown granular casts in the urine sediment are a hallmark of atn. diabetic nephropathy and malignant hypertension can cause chronic kidney disease but are less likely to cause acute kidney injury in this setting. interstitial nephritis is a less common cause of acute kidney injury and is typically associated with medication use or other systemic diseases.",ans: c
"1595. a 78yo pt is diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer; there is no cure for his condition. his son tells the physician that in the case of a diagnosis of cancer, the physician must not tell his father. he wishes that his father does not suffer any psychological distress caused by the knowledge of a terminal diagnosis. which one of the following ethical principles supports the son’s request?",a. patient autonomy,b. beneficence,c. justice,d. non-maleficence,,,,,,,,"chat: the son's request is based on the principle of non-maleficence, which is the ethical principle of avoiding harm or preventing harm. the son believes that telling the father about his diagnosis will cause him psychological distress, which would be harmful. however, this request conflicts with the ethical principle of patient autonomy, which supports the patient's right to know about their medical condition and make decisions about their own care. the principle of beneficence supports actions that promote the well-being of the patient, and the principle of justice supports fairness and equality in the distribution of healthcare resources. in this case, the physician must balance these ethical principles and make a decision that is in the best interest of the patient while respecting his autonomy.",ans: d
"1596. a 23yo single male was brought to emergency exhausted and frightened. his father tells you that his son, who was previously healthy, had, for no apparent reason, a sudden attack of fear, dizziness, sweating, palpitations and the feeling that his heart is going to stop beating. the symptoms started to decrease gradually after about 10 minutes. which is the most likely dx?",a. panic attack,b. delirious state,c. alcohol withdrawal phenomena,d. social phobia,,,,,,,,"chat: panic attack is characterized by sudden and intense fear or discomfort, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, palpitations, and the feeling of impending doom or death. it usually lasts for a few",ans: a
"1597. a 30yo woman, g2p1, at 37 weeks gestation mentions that her 3-year-old son has just developed chickenpox. she is not certain whether she has had the disease herself. which is the next step in management?",a. administration of varicella-zoster immune globulin im,b. measurement of varicella igm level,c. acyclovir tablets orally,d. measurement of varicella igg level,,,,,,,,"chat: correct, the next step in management would be to measure the woman's varicella igg level to determine if she has had a previous infection with the virus and is therefore immune. if the igg level is positive, no further intervention is needed. if the igg level is negative, the woman should receive varicella vaccine within 3-5 days of exposure to prevent or decrease the severity of the infection. option a, administration of varicella-zoster immune globulin, may be considered in high-risk patients who are not immune and are exposed to chickenpox, but it is not the first-line approach in this case. option b, measurement of varicella igm level, is not recommended because igm antibodies may not be detectable until 3-5 days after onset of symptoms, and the woman is asymptomatic. option c, acyclovir tablets, may be considered in pregnant women with chickenpox infection, but it is not the first-line approach in this case.",ans: d
"1598. a 24yo primigravida presents to the ed with a history of 8-week amenorrhoea followed by heavy vaginal bleeding and severe, crampy abdominal pain. exam: hr=110/min and bp=120/80mmhg. the uterus is bulky. the cervix is dilated and there is active bleeding from the cervical os, but no tissue has been expelled. which of the following is the most likely dx?",a. inevitable abortion,b. threatened abortion,c. incomplete abortion,d. missed abortion,,,,,,,,"chat: i'm sorry, but the key provided is incorrect. the description in the question is actually consistent with an incomplete abortion, not an inevitable abortion. incomplete abortion is characterized by heavy vaginal bleeding, severe crampy abdominal pain, cervical dilation, and passage of some but not all products of conception. therefore, the correct answer is c. incomplete abortion. inevitable abortion is characterized by moderate to heavy bleeding, cervical dilation, rupture of membranes, and contractions without the expulsion of the fetus and placenta. threatened abortion is characterized by vaginal bleeding with a closed cervical os and no passage of tissue. missed abortion is characterized by fetal demise without the passage of tissue or uterine contraction.",ans: c
"1599. a 46yo woman comes for a routine gynaecological visit. on pelvic examination, a 1-cm red, granular lesion is noted on the posterior cervical lip, which is firm and bleeds on contact. which is the next best step for establishing a dx?",a. cervical cytological smear,b. punch biopsy,c. transvaginal ultrasound,d. colposcopy,,,,,,,,"chat: the most appropriate next step for establishing a diagnosis of the red, granular lesion on the posterior cervical lip would be a punch biopsy. this will provide a histopathological diagnosis and guide further management. a cervical cytological smear may detect abnormal cells, but it cannot differentiate between various cervical lesions. transvaginal ultrasound is not useful for diagnosing cervical lesions. colposcopy may be used to visualize the lesion, but a punch biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis. therefore, punch biopsy is the best option.",ans: b
"1600. a 31yo woman, g5p4, who has amenorrhoea for 12 weeks and a positive pregnancy test presents to the ed with vaginal bleeding. symphysial-fundal height measurement corresponds to 22 weeks gestation. ultrasound examination reveals bilateral cystic masses. no fetal parts are seen during the examination. the cervix is closed. which is the most likely dx?",a. tubal pregnancy,b. endometriosis,c. hydatidiform mole,d. threatened abortion,,,,,,,,"chat: this question describes a patient with amenorrhoea, positive pregnancy test, and vaginal bleeding. the symphysial-fundal height measurement corresponds to 22 weeks gestation, but ultrasound examination reveals bilateral cystic masses and no fetal parts. this suggests the most likely diagnosis is a hydatidiform mole, which is an abnormal pregnancy where the placenta develops into a mass of cysts with no fetal parts. tubal pregnancy (option a) can present with vaginal bleeding and positive pregnancy test, but the uterus is not enlarged and the symphysial-fundal height measurement would not correspond to 22 weeks gestation. endometriosis (option b) is not a likely diagnosis in this case as it is a condition where endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus, but would not present with the symptoms described in this question. threatened abortion (option d) is a possibility as it can present with vaginal bleeding and a closed cervix, but the symphysial-fundal height measurement corresponding to 22 weeks gestation and the presence of cystic masses on ultrasound make this diagnosis less likely.",ans: c
"1601. a married 25yo woman presents with 6h hx of abdominal pain located in the lif. the pain is persistent, of increasing intensity and not radiating first experienced while she was lying down. she feels giddy when she tries to stand erect. the last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. the radial pulse=130/min and bp=80/40 mmhg. pelvic us shows free intra-peritoneal fluid. what is the most appropriate next step in management?",a. immediate laparoscopy.,b. immediate laparotomy.,c. pregnancy test (urine or serum).,d. observation for 24 hours in the icu,,,,,,,,"chat: i agree with the answer. this patient's presentation is concerning for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, which is a medical emergency. the presence of free intra-peritoneal fluid on pelvic ultrasound is highly suggestive of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. the patient is also in shock, with a high heart rate, low blood pressure, and giddiness on standing, indicating significant blood loss. immediate surgical intervention with laparotomy is necessary to control bleeding and remove the ectopic pregnancy. delaying treatment could lead to life-threatening complications such as hemorrhagic shock. the other options listed are not appropriate as they do not address the urgent need for surgical intervention.",ans: b
1602. a 40yo man has fallen off a roof. he is shocked and has chest pain. there is a delay between the radial and femoral pulse. his cxr=widening of the mediastinum. what is the single most likely dx?,a. cardiac tamponade,b. diaphragmatic rupture,c. fx ribs,d. tension pneumothorax,e. traumatic rupture of aorta,,,,,,,"chat: the key is e. traumatic rupture of the aorta. [a traumatic aortic disruption is caused by a rapid acceleration (or deceleration) causing a tear in the aorta. normally this is immediately fatal, but those who survive may show a widened mediastinum on cxr. this can be confirmed with ct scan or angiography of the aorta and requires prompt surgical correction. stable the haemodynamics and surgical correction. note: pts with diaphragmatic rupture usually presents days after trauma with vague symptoms, history is vital]. that is correct. in a patient who has suffered blunt chest trauma, a widened mediastinum on cxr with delay or discrepancy between the radial and femoral pulse is highly suggestive of a traumatic rupture of the aorta. this is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate surgical intervention. cardiac tamponade would usually present with beck's triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and distended neck veins), while tension pneumothorax would present with absent breath sounds on one side and tracheal deviation. fractured ribs would not cause the characteristic findings seen in this patient. diaphragmatic rupture would present with delayed onset of symptoms and may not be immediately life-threatening.",ans: e
1603. a 36yo woman presents with swelling in the groin. exam: swelling is diffuse and soft and lies below the inguinal ligament. it empties with minimal pressure and refills with release. there is a cough impulse and it disappears on lying down. on the calf of the same leg there are varicosities on the medial aspect. what is the most likely dx?,a. varicose vein,b. varicocele,c. saphena varix,d. femoral hernia,e. inguinal hernia,,,,,,,"chat: yes, that's correct! a saphena varix is a type of varicose vein that occurs in the saphenous vein, which runs up the leg and passes through the groin. the symptoms described in the case, such as the swelling below the inguinal ligament, the cough impulse, and the disappearance on lying down, are all characteristic of a saphena varix. the varicosity in the calf also supports this diagnosis, as it suggests a systemic problem with venous circulation in the leg. the other options, such as varicose vein and varicocele, may also be considered, but the specific features described in the case make saphena varix the most likely diagnosis.",ans: c
1604. a man presents with a swelling above the groin crease in the abdomen. he has not had any med problems of note. what is the most probable dx?,a. inguinal hernia,b. spigelian hernia,c. testicular tumor,d. epidydimal cyst,e. irreducible hernia,,,,,,,"chat: b. spigelian hernia. [a spigelian hernia (or lateral ventral hernia) is a hernia through the spigelian fascia, which is the aponeurotic layer between the rectus abdominis muscle medially, and the semilunar line laterally].  inguinal hernia: typically presents as a bulge in the groin, not above the groin crease in the abdomen. testicular tumor: would present as a mass in the scrotum or groin area, not above the groin crease in the abdomen. epididymal cyst: would also present as a mass in the scrotum or groin area, not above the groin crease in the abdomen. irreducible hernia: would present as a persistent bulge that cannot be pushed back in, and may cause pain and other symptoms.",ans: b
"1605. a 70yo man presents with acutely painful, pale paralysed and pulseless left leg. he is noted to have a-fib. what is the most probable dx?",a. intermittent claudication,b. cardiovascular syphilis,c. buerger’s disease,d. chronic limb ischemia,e. acute limb ischemia,,,,,,,"chat: yes, that is correct. a-fib is a known risk factor for embolic events, and acute limb ischemia can present with sudden onset of severe pain, pallor, paralysis, and absent pulses. option a, intermittent claudication, refers to pain in the legs during physical activity that improves with rest and is usually due to chronic arterial insufficiency. option b, cardiovascular syphilis, is a rare complication of untreated syphilis that can involve the aorta and its branches, but it is unlikely to cause sudden limb ischemia. option c, buerger's disease, is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease that affects the small- and medium-sized arteries and veins of the extremities and can cause ischemic ulcers, but acute limb ischemia is not a typical presentation. option d, chronic limb ischemia, can cause claudication, ischemic rest pain, and non-healing ulcers, but it is not the likely diagnosis in this case due to the sudden onset of symptoms.",ans: e
1606. a 50yo woman complains of several months hx of weakness and difficulty climbing stairs. exam: fissuring of the skin of her hands. cxr: pulmonary fibrosis. what is the single most likely positive antibody?,a. anti jo1,b. anti scl 70,c. anti ro,d. anti dsdna,e. anti centromere,,,,,,,"chat: the answer provided is incorrect. the given clinical scenario is more consistent with dermatomyositis than polymyositis, as indicated by the presence of skin findings (fissuring of the skin of her hands). the correct answer is b. anti scl 70, which is commonly associated with diffuse scleroderma, a connective tissue disorder that can present with both pulmonary fibrosis and dermatomyositis-like skin changes. anti jo1 is associated with polymyositis, but is not the single most likely positive antibody in this scenario. anti dsdna and anti ro are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and sjogren's syndrome, respectively, and are not likely to be positive in this case. anti centromere is associated with limited scleroderma, which would not typically present with pulmonary fibrosis or myositis.",ans: b
1607. a 65yo woman complaining of symptoms suggestive of raynaud’s phenomenon and difficulty in swallowing. exam: painful lesions on her finger tips and facial telangiectasis. what is the single most likely positive antibody?,a. anti jo1,b. anti scl 70,c. anti ro,d. anti ds dna,e. anti centromere,,,,,,,"chat: the key is e. anti-centromere. [the presence of raynaud's phenomenon, painful lesions on fingertips, and facial telangiectasis is suggestive of crest syndrome, which is a subtype of scleroderma. anti-centromere antibodies are present in the majority of patients with crest syndrome, making it the most likely positive antibody].",ans: e
1608. a 6yo boy presented about 4h ago with acute severe pain on the testis with the left half slightly higher than the right. pain was not relieved by any strong analgesic. what is the initial management?,a. give strong analgesic,b. iv ns and monitor vital signs,c. reassure,d. immediate surgical referral,e. cover with antibiotics,,,,,,,"chat: yes, the correct answer is d, immediate surgical referral. this is because the history suggests torsion of the testis, which is a surgical emergency. strong analgesics, iv fluids, and antibiotics may be given as supportive therapy, but the definitive treatment is surgical repair. reassurance alone is not appropriate in this case.",ans: d
1609. a 60yo man is brought to the ed in an agitated state. he is lashing out violently. which drug in low dosage due to its relative lack of autonomic side effects is a drug of choice in the tx of agitation in this pt?,a. haloperidol,b. diazepam,c. fluoxetine,d. clozapine,e. chlorpromazine,,,,,,,"chat: the correct answer is b. diazepam. diazepam is a benzodiazepine that is often used in the treatment of acute agitation due to its rapid onset of action and relative lack of autonomic side effects. haloperidol and chlorpromazine are typical antipsychotics that may be used in the management of agitation, but they have more autonomic side effects compared to benzodiazepines. fluoxetine is an antidepressant and clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic, neither of which are typically used for acute agitation.",ans: b
"1610. a 32yo woman of 40wks gestation attends the antenatal day unit with sudden onset epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting. she is clinically jaundiced. her biochemistry results show a raised bilirubin, abnormal liver enzymes, high uric acid and hypoglycemia. what’s the most likely dx?",a. acute fatty liver of pregnancy,b. obstetric cholestasis,c. cholecystitis,d. hellp syndrome,e. acute hepatitis,,,,,,,"chat: the key is a. acute fatty liver of pregnancy. [when jaundice is present in pregnancy, aflp should be high on the differential. pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, fever with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin are indicative of aflp. also can have elevated inr, tlc and hypoglycaemia. obstetric cholestasis typically presents with pruritus without jaundice or significant liver enzyme abnormalities. cholecystitis would present with right upper quadrant pain, not epigastric pain. hellp syndrome also presents with jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, but typically with hypertension and proteinuria. acute hepatitis would not present with hypoglycemia or high uric acid levels].",ans: a
1611. a 24yo man believes his bowels are blocked and his life is in ruin. what kind of delusion is he suffering from?,a. persecutory,b. factitious,c. guilt,d. nihilistic,e. hypochondriacal,,,,,,,"chat: the key is d. nihilistic. [the man believes his bowels are blocked and his life is ruined is an example of nihilistic delusion]. persecutory delusions involve the belief that one is being threatened, harassed, or persecuted by someone or something. factitious disorder is a mental illness in which a person acts as if they have a physical or mental illness when they don’t actually have it. guilt delusions involve the belief that one has committed a serious sin or crime, despite evidence to the contrary. hypochondriacal delusions involve the belief that one has a serious illness, despite medical evidence to the contrary.",ans: d
"1612. a 75yo man with declining vision, cornea and pupils are normal, fundus shows obscured margins. what is the single most likely dx?",a. macular degeneration,b. htn retinopathy,c. ms,d. dm background,e. proliferative dm retinopathy,,,,,,,"chat: i'm sorry, but i must point out that the given answer is incorrect. macular degeneration does not cause papilledema, which is a condition characterized by swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure. in fact, macular degeneration typically presents with drusen deposits and/or pigment changes in the macula, which can lead to central vision loss. without additional information, it is difficult to determine the most likely diagnosis based on the given presentation. however, some possibilities to consider are: glaucoma: a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve and can lead to vision loss. in particular, open-angle glaucoma (the most common type) can cause gradual vision loss without any noticeable symptoms until it's advanced. the obscured margins on fundus exam could be indicative of optic nerve damage. retinal vein occlusion: a blockage in one of the veins that carry blood away from the retina. this can cause visual changes, including blurred or distorted vision, as well as obscured margins on fundus exam. other retinal disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration (though the papilledema mentioned in the question would not be consistent with this diagnosis) or diabetic retinopathy (which would typically show more specific changes on fundus exam). therefore, i cannot provide a single most likely diagnosis without additional information.",ans: a
1613. a man under psychiatric tx develops gi distress and tremors. which drug is most likely to cause these symptoms?,a. lithium,b. diazepam,c. citalopram,d. clozapine,e. imipramine,,,,,,,"chat: yes, that is correct. lithium is known to cause tremors, gastrointestinal distress, and other adverse effects such as weight gain, acne, and increased thirst. diazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and muscle relaxation, and may cause drowsiness and confusion. citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) used for depression and anxiety, and may cause sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and nausea. clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for schizophrenia and may cause weight gain, sedation, and agranulocytosis. imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant used for depression and may cause dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision.",ans: a
1614. a 24yo man presents with painless hematuria. no other complaint and no abnormality is found on physical exam. what is the most appropriate initial inv which is helpful to get a dx?,a. coag screening,b. msu,c. cystoscopy,d. mri spine,e. abdominal us,,,,,,,"chat: painless hematuria in a young male without any other findings on history or examination often suggests underlying urologic pathology such as urologic malignancy or urolithiasis. the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient would be a renal and bladder ultrasound (option e), as it can identify urinary tract abnormalities such as tumors, stones, or congenital anomalies. coagulation screening (option a) would not be useful unless there were additional symptoms or signs suggesting a bleeding disorder. a midstream urine (msu) test (option b) may be helpful to exclude infection but would not identify the underlying cause of hematuria. cystoscopy (option c) is an invasive procedure and not typically performed as an initial investigation for hematuria. an mri of the spine (option d) would not be indicated unless there were specific signs or symptoms suggesting spinal cord pathology.",ans: e
1615. a 29yo woman presents to her gp with troublesome heavy periods. the med tx that she has tried have made little difference. she is known to have large uterine intramural fibroids. you confirm that she is currently trying for more children. select the most appropriate management for menorrhagia in this pt?,a. danazol,b. endometrial ablation,c. hysterectomy,d. hysteroscopic resection of fibroids,e. myomectomy,,,,,,,chat: this is correct. myomectomy is the most appropriate management for menorrhagia in a patient with large uterine intramural fibroids who is currently trying for more children. danazol can cause infertility and is not recommended for women trying to conceive. endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are more radical surgical procedures and are not the first line of management for fibroids in women who still desire fertility. hysteroscopic resection of fibroids is appropriate for submucous fibroids but not for intramural fibroids.,ans: e
1616. a 30yo schizophrenic female attacks her mother believing that aliens have replaced her with an exact double. what condition is she suffering from?,a. capgras syndrome,b. ganser syndrome,c. todd syndrome,d. fregoli syndrome,e. cotard syndrome,,,,,,,"chat: capgras syndrome. [capgras syndrome is an irrational belief that a familiar person or place has been replaced by a duplicate. ganser syndrome is a fictitious disorder in which a patient deliberately acts as if he has a physical or mental illness when he doesn’t have it. todd syndrome/alice in wonderland syndrome/lilliputian syndrome is a disorienting neurological condition affecting human perception of size, shape and time. fregoli syndrome is a delusion of doubles, a delusional belief that different ppl are infact a single person in disguise or change appearance. cotard’s syndrome/nihilistic delusions is ‘walking corpse syndrome’, the person think they are dead or that one of their organs has stopped functioning].",ans: a
"1617. a 38yo man has just returned from a holiday where he went swimming everyday. for the last few days he has had irritation in both ears. now his right ear is hot, red, swollen and acutely painful. what is the single most likely dx?",a. foreign body,b. impacted earwax,c. oe,d. om,e. perforation of eardrum,,,,,,,"chat: that is correct! otitis externa (oe) is an inflammation or infection of the external ear canal, which can be caused by water exposure, trauma, or bacteria. the symptoms described in the scenario are characteristic of oe. foreign body and impacted earwax could cause ear irritation, but they are less likely to cause the acute onset of pain, redness, and swelling seen in this case. otitis media (om) is an infection of the middle ear, which can cause ear pain, fever, and hearing loss, but it usually does not cause redness and swelling of the external ear canal. perforation of the eardrum can cause pain and hearing loss, but it is not typically associated with the redness and swelling seen in oe.",ans: c
1618. a healthy 2yo boy is brought to the ed having cut his hand playing in the garden. he has a 2cm clean laceration. he has not received any routine immunizations as his parents are concerned about possible side effects. there are no contraindications to immunizations. what is the single most appropriate follow up inv?,a. courses of dpt vaccine,b. courses of dt,c. single inj of dpt vaccine,d. single inj of dt,e. single inj of tetanus ig,,,,,,,"chat: yes, the correct answer is a. courses of dpt vaccine. the child has a clean laceration and is at risk for tetanus, which is a serious bacterial infection that can be prevented by vaccination. the most appropriate course of action in this case is to provide the child with a full course of dpt (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) vaccine. the dt vaccine, which is used for children who cannot receive the pertussis component of the vaccine, would not be the best option in this case since the child is otherwise healthy and can receive the full vaccine. a single injection of either dpt or dt would not provide full protection against tetanus, and a single injection of tetanus ig would only provide temporary protection. therefore, the best course of action is to provide the child with the recommended course of dpt vaccination.",ans: a
"1619. a 6wk child has hx of frequent vomiting which became worse during the last weeks. he has no fever, recently he has passed stool only once every 2-3d. what inv will you do to confirm the dx?",a. abdominal us,b. barium meal,c. erect xr abdomen,d. feed test,e. reassure,,,,,,,"chat: yes, the correct answer is a. abdominal us. pyloric stenosis is a common cause of vomiting in infants and can be confirmed with an abdominal ultrasound, which will show hypertrophy of the pylorus. barium meal and erect x-ray abdomen are not used for the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. a feed test may be used in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux, but it is not helpful in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. reassurance is not appropriate in this case, as the baby's symptoms need to be evaluated and treated.",ans: a
1620. a 30yo woman had an iucd inserted 8-9m ago. now on routine follow up the thread is missing. uterine us showed no iucd in the uterus. what is the best management?,a. laparoscopy,b. pelvic ct,c. laparotomy,d. pelvic xr,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is d. pelvic xr. [ultrasound should be arranged to locate the device. if ultrasound does not locate the device and there is no definite history of expulsion then abdominal x-ray should be performed to look for an extrauterine device]. just to clarify, the answer is d. pelvic xr because it is the most appropriate next step to take when an iucd thread is missing and a uterine ultrasound does not show the device in the uterus. a pelvic x-ray is used to detect whether the device has migrated outside of the uterus. laparoscopy, laparotomy, and pelvic ct are more invasive procedures that may be considered if the iucd is not found on x-ray and further investigation is needed.",ans: d
1621. a pt comes with weight loss and sleep disturbance has mild depression. he has a hx of mi. what is the single most appropriate tx?,a. diazepam,b. ect,c. imipramine,d. lithium,e. antipsychotics,,,,,,,"chat: the key is a. diazepam. [treatment for mild depression is cbt. as the patient has mi imipramine is not suitable and in mild depression antidepressant is usually not given. as the patient has sleep disturbance diazepam can be given]. it's important to note that while diazepam can be used to manage sleep disturbance, it is not a first-line treatment for depression. the correct management for mild depression typically involves psychotherapy (such as cbt) or possibly an antidepressant medication. additionally, the choice of medication should take into account the patient's medical history, so it is not appropriate to automatically rule out antidepressants due to the patient's history of mi without further evaluation by a psychiatrist. ect and lithium are typically reserved for more severe or treatment-resistant depression, and antipsychotics are generally not recommended for the treatment of mild depression.",ans: a
1622. a pt. comes back from india and presents with night sweats and lymphadenopathy. xr: cavitation. what investigation should be done next?,a. ct scan,b. afb stain,c. blood culture,d. bronchoscopy,,,,,,,,"chat: the key is b. afb stain. the patient's presentation with night sweats, lymphadenopathy, and cavitary lesion on chest x-ray is highly suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis, especially given the recent travel history to india. the next step in the management would be to obtain sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (afb) stain, which is a quick and inexpensive diagnostic test for tuberculosis. ct scan, blood culture, and bronchoscopy may be indicated later in the diagnostic workup, but afb stain is the most appropriate initial investigation.",ans: b
1623. a 45yo woman has been extensively investigated for a lump she believes to be cancer. she doesn’t think doctors take her seriously and demands another referral. what term best describes her condition?,a. munchausen syndrome,b. munchausen’s by proxy,c. hypochondriasis,d. malingering,e. phobia,,,,,,,"chat: correct. hypochondriasis, now referred to as somatic symptom disorder, is characterized by excessive worry about having a serious illness despite medical reassurance that there is no evidence of such an illness. people with this disorder may become preoccupied with normal bodily sensations and interpret them as signs of serious illness, leading to repeated visits to healthcare providers and unnecessary medical testing. munchausen syndrome involves deliberately feigning or producing symptoms of illness for the purpose of assuming the sick role and receiving medical attention, while munchausen's by proxy involves intentionally causing or fabricating symptoms in another person for attention or sympathy. malingering refers to the intentional exaggeration or fabrication of symptoms for secondary gain, such as financial compensation or avoiding work, while phobia involves an intense fear or avoidance of a specific object or situation.",ans: c
1624. a 15yo man presents with bitemporal hemianopia and spade-like hands. what is the definite test to confirm the dx?,a. early morning growth hormone,b. insulin tolerance test,c. ogtt with growth hormone measurements,d. random insulin-like growth factor (igf-1),e. short acth test,,,,,,,"chat: the answer is c, ogtt with growth hormone measurements. acromegaly is a disorder caused by excessive growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. bitemporal hemianopia and spade-like hands are classic features of acromegaly. although random insulin-like growth factor (igf-1) may be elevated in acromegaly, it is not a definitive test. an early morning growth hormone level may be elevated in acromegaly, but it is not specific enough for diagnosis. an insulin tolerance test is used to diagnose growth hormone deficiency, not excess. the short acth test is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. therefore, the definitive test for acromegaly is ogtt with serial growth hormone measurements.",ans: c
"1625. a 22yo man has had an acute, painful, red right eye with blurring of vision for one day. he had a similar episode 1y ago and has had episodic back pain and stiffness relieved by exercise and diclofenac for four years. what is the single most likely cause of his red eye?",a. chorioretinitis,b. conjunctivitis,c. episcleritis,d. iritis,e. keratitis,,,,,,,"chat: the key is d. iritis. [the symptoms described are characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis (lower back pain and stiffness which gets better after moving around and taking nsaids) the extra articular manifestations of as is iritis]. yes, that's correct! iritis, or anterior uveitis, is a known extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis. the symptoms described in the question stem, including the sudden onset of painful, red eye with blurring of vision, are also characteristic of iritis. the other options are less likely based on the information given, although conjunctivitis may also cause a red eye, it is less likely to be associated with back pain and stiffness.",ans: d
"1626. a 40yo divorced man with bipolar affective disorder attends hospital following an od of 30 tca tablets. his new partner has left him and he has stopped taking his medicine and begun drinking heavily. he appears depressed, feels hopeless and is ambivalent about being alive. he is now fit for discharge from the medical ward and acknowledges the benefits of previous tx. what is the single most appropriate next management?",a. admission to the psychiatry ward,b. arrange psychiatric outpatient follow-up,c. discharge to the care of the general practitioner,d. referral to local alcohol treatment team,e. referral to clinical psychologist,,,,,,,"chat: i'm sorry, but i cannot confirm or deny the correctness of this answer without additional information. the management of suicidal behavior is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a thorough assessment of the patient's clinical and social circumstances. in general, the primary goal of managing suicidal behavior is to ensure the patient's safety and prevent future suicidal acts. this may involve a combination of medical and psychiatric interventions, including hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and social support. the appropriate management of the patient in this case will depend on several factors, including the severity of the patient's symptoms, the level of risk for suicidal behavior, and the availability of support resources.",ans: a
1627. a healthy baby boy is born at term to a woman who was unwell with confirmed acute hep b during pregnancy. the mother is very concerned that she may have infected the baby with hep  b. what single preventative intervention should be given to the baby?,a. full course of hepatitis b vaccine,b. hepatitis b immunoglobulin alone,c. hepatitis b vaccine and hepatitis b immunoglobulin,d. hepatitis b vaccine as single dose,e. none until hepatitis b status confirmed,,,,,,,"chat: the correct answer is c, hepatitis b vaccine and hepatitis b immunoglobulin. infants born to mothers with acute or chronic hepatitis b are at high risk of acquiring hepatitis b infection. administration of hepatitis b vaccine and hepatitis b immunoglobulin (hbig) within 12 hours of birth is recommended for infants born to mothers with acute or chronic hepatitis b. the hepatitis b vaccine is given to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against hepatitis b, while hbig provides immediate protection against the virus until the vaccine has time to take effect. option a (full course of hepatitis b vaccine) alone is not sufficient for infants born to mothers with acute or chronic hepatitis b. option b (hbig alone) does not provide long-term protection against the virus. option d (hepatitis b vaccine as single dose) is not adequate for infants born to mothers with acute or chronic hepatitis b. option e (none until hepatitis b status confirmed) is not recommended, as infants born to mothers with acute or chronic hepatitis b are at high risk of acquiring the infection.",ans: c
"1628. a previously well 15yo girl had an acute onset of fever, sweating, bruising and petechiae. a blood count showed: hgb=63g/l, wbc=1.1mg/l, neutrophils=0.1, plt=14. no abnormal white cells were seen on the blood film. she was transfused and given iv antibiotics and her condition improved. 3wks later her blood count has returned to a similar picture. what is the single most likely underlying dx?",a. all,b. aml,c. aplastic anemia,d. cml,e. pernicious anemia,,,,,,,"chat: aplastic anemia is a rare but serious condition where the bone marrow doesn't produce enough new blood cells. the symptoms, including fever, bruising, and petechiae, are caused by a low platelet count. the blood count results show a pancytopenic picture, which means there is a deficiency of all three blood cell types: red blood cells (hgb), white blood cells (wbc), and platelets (plt). the absence of abnormal white cells on the blood film rules out leukemia (all, aml, and cml), and the age of the patient makes pernicious anemia unlikely as well.",ans: c
1629. an 83yo woman admitted with a chest infection becomes confused with impaired attention and poor concentration. she is restless and frightened. she is verbally abusive and has perceptual abnormalities. there is no significant prv psychiatric hx. what is the single most likely dx?,a. delirium,b. drug induced psychosis,c. lewy body dementia,d. multi-infarct dementia,e. psychotic depression,,,,,,,"chat: delirium is a common condition in elderly patients, particularly in response to acute medical illness. the symptoms described in the question, such as confusion, impaired attention and concentration, restlessness, perceptual abnormalities, and verbal abuse, are typical features of delirium. drug-induced psychosis, lewy body dementia, multi-infarct dementia, and psychotic depression are all possible differential diagnoses, but they are less likely than delirium given the clinical scenario described.",ans: a
"1630. a town has a population of 500,000. in a five year period there are 1250 cases of bladder cancer diagnosed at the only hospital. during the same period the occupational health department diagnosed a further 500 cases. what is the annual incidence per million of bladder cancer in this population?",a. 2100,b. 1750,c. 1400,d. 700,e. 350,,,,,,,"chat: to calculate the incidence rate, we need to divide the total number of cases by the total population and then multiply by a factor to convert it to per million per year. total cases of bladder cancer = 1250 + 500 = 1750 total population = 500,000 incidence rate = (1750/500,000) x (1,000,000/5) = 700 therefore, the correct answer is d. 700.",ans: d
1631. a 28yo woman who has had a prv pulmonary embolism in pregnancy wishes to discuss contraception. she has menorrhagia but is otherwise well. what is the single most suitable contraceptive method for this patient?,a. cocp,b. copper iucd,c. levonorgestrel intra-uterine system,d. progestogen implant,e. pop,,,,,,,"chat: correct, the key answer is c. levonorgestrel intra-uterine system. this patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, which is a contraindication to combined hormonal contraceptives such as cocp (option a) and nuvaring. copper iucd (option b) is an effective method but may increase menstrual bleeding, which could be a problem in this patient who already has menorrhagia. the progestogen implant (option d) and pop (option e) are both progestogen-only methods, which are generally considered safe in patients with a history of thromboembolism, but may also worsen menorrhagia. the most suitable option is therefore the levonorgestrel intra-uterine system (lng-ius) (option c), which not only provides highly effective contraception but also reduces menstrual bleeding.",ans: c
1632. an 8yo girl has had left earache for 2d. the earache subsided about 2h ago with the onset of a purulent discharge which relieved the pain. her temperature is 39.2c. what is the single most appropriate antibiotic?,a. amoxicillin,b. ciprofloxacin,c. clindamycin,d. erythromycin,e. flucloxacillin,,,,,,,"chat: the key is a. amoxicillin. [this is the picture of acute otitis media which has led to tympanic membrane perforation. po amoxicillin for 7 days is the antibiotic of choice]. just to add some more information, amoxicillin is the first-line antibiotic for the treatment of acute otitis media (aom) in children. it is effective against the most common pathogens causing aom, including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and flucloxacillin are not recommended as first-line treatment for aom in children.",ans: a

"1634. a 65yo man had closure of colostomy performed 5d ago. he is not systemically unwell. there is a tender, localised fluctuant swelling 4 cm in diameter in the wound. what is the single most appropriate management?",a. abdominal support,b. antibiotics,c. laparotomy and re-suture wound,d. local exploration of wound,e. observation,,,,,,,"chat: the most likely diagnosis is an abscess at the surgical site, and the most appropriate management is local exploration of the wound to drain the abscess. options a and e are inappropriate because they do not address the underlying problem of the abscess. option b may be considered, but alone it would not be sufficient to treat the abscess and drainage would still be necessary. option c is too invasive for a localized problem that can be managed with a less invasive approach. therefore, the best option is d, local exploration of the wound.",ans: d
"1635. a 32yo woman has had a febrile illness and swelling of the small joints of her hands, feet, wrists and knees for two days. she has a maculopapular rash and a few palpable, small cervical lymph nodes. she was previously well. there is no history of relevant travel outside the uk. she has two young children. what is the single most likely dx?",a. psoriasis,b. reactive arthritis,c. rheumatoid arthritis,d. sarcoidosis,e. sle,,,,,,,"chat: reactive arthritis, also known as reiter's syndrome, typically presents as an acute febrile illness with asymmetric oligoarthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis, occurring following a bacterial infection. the presence of small joint involvement, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy in this case also supports the diagnosis of reactive arthritis. psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis would typically have a chronic course, while sarcoidosis and sle are less likely to present with joint involvement as the predominant symptom.",ans: b
1636. a 16yo girl has had an enlarging mass in the right side of her neck for the last 6wks. she has had no other symptoms. she has a 2 x 2 cm enlarged ln in the anterior triangle of the neck with several smaller associated ln palpable. oropharyngeal examination shows tonsillar membranes. what is the single most likely dx?,a. infectious mononucleosis,b. leukaemia,c. lymphoma,d. sarcoidosis,e. tuberculosis,,,,,,,"chat: infectious mononucleosis (im) is a common viral infection caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv) that affects the lymphoid tissue. it is characterized by fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. the enlarged lymph nodes are usually located in the posterior cervical chain, but they can also be found in other regions of the neck, including the anterior triangle. the tonsils are often enlarged and covered with a white exudate. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis can also present with lymphadenopathy, but the clinical picture and examination findings are different from those of im.",ans: a
"1637. a 60yo man has had increasing pain in both buttocks, thighs and calves on walking for three months. he has also recently developed impotence. femoral and distal pulses are absent in both limbs. what is the single most likely site of arterial obstruction?",a. aorto iliac,b. external iliac,c. femoropopliteal,d. internal iliac,e. tibial,,,,,,,"chat: leriche's syndrome is a triad of symptoms caused by aortoiliac occlusive disease, which includes buttock and thigh claudication, absent femoral pulses, and erectile dysfunction. treatment may involve surgical intervention to remove the obstructing material, such as a saddle embolus in this case.",ans: a
"1638. a 78yo man has collapsed. he has had a severe headache for 12 hours and had an urti 3d ago. he has a temp=39.2c, pulse=122bpm, bp=84/60mmhg and rr=34bpm but his chest is clear. he has a gcs=10 and some neck stiffness. he has been started on high-flow oxygen. what is the single most appropriate immediate management?",a. iv antibiotic; ct brain scan,b. iv antibiotic; lp,c. iv fluids; ct brain scan,d. iv fluids; iv antibiotic,e. iv fluids; lp,,,,,,,"chat: note: in cases of suspected meningitis, immediate administration of antibiotics and fluids is crucial. lp should be considered but only after the patient is stabilized and a ct scan has ruled out any contraindications, such as raised intracranial pressure. however, in this scenario, a ct brain scan is not mentioned as an option, and given the patient's unstable vital signs and suspicion for meningitis, immediate administration of iv fluids and antibiotics is the most appropriate initial management.",ans: d
"1639. a 16yo boy was brought to hospital in a comatose state having taken methadone belonging to his sister. he was given naloxone and rapidly became alert. some hours later, he gradually becomes semi-conscious again.what is the single most likely reason for this patient becoming semi-conscious again in hospital?",a. methadone hepatotoxicity has caused acute liver failure,b. methadone is eliminated from the body more slowly than naloxone,c. naloxone is a partial agonist at the central nervous system opioid receptor,d. the pt has misused another substance that has caused an intracranial bleed,e. the pt has misused another substance that is absorbed more slowly than methadone,,,,,,,"chat: methadone has a longer half-life than naloxone, meaning that it stays in the body longer and can cause a recurrence of symptoms such as sedation or respiratory depression. naloxone, on the other hand, has a shorter half-life and is rapidly eliminated from the body, which is why it is often given as a first-line treatment for opioid overdose. the other options are not likely causes for the patient's semi-conscious state.",ans: b
"1640. a 27yo woman who takes the cocp has had painless vaginal spotting and discharge for 3 days. her last menstrual period, which lasted four days, finished 10 days ago. her last cervical smear two years ago was normal. abdominal and vaginal examinations are normal apart from a mild ectropion with contact bleeding. what is the single most appropriate initial inv?",a. cervical smear,b. colposcopy,c. endocervical swab,d. endometrial biopsy,e. pelvic us,,,,,,,"chat: the most appropriate initial investigation in this case would be an endocervical swab to test for sexually transmitted infections (stis) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, which can cause vaginal spotting and discharge. a cervical smear is not indicated at this point, as the patient's last smear was normal and she is not due for another for another year. colposcopy and endometrial biopsy are not indicated in the absence of any abnormal findings on examination, and pelvic ultrasound is not indicated for this presentation.",ans: c
1641. a 72yo man being investigated for anaemia is booked for a colonoscopy in 24 hours. what is the single most appropriate management the night before the procedure?,a. bisacodyl tablets,b. glycerine suppository,c. lactulose syrup,d. magnesium citrate (orally),e. senna tablets,,,,,,,"chat: the most appropriate management for a patient scheduled for a colonoscopy is bowel preparation to ensure that the colon is clean and free of fecal matter that could interfere with visualization during the procedure. magnesium citrate is a hyperosmotic laxative that works by drawing water into the bowel and increasing peristalsis. it is a safe and effective option for bowel preparation, especially when given orally the night before the procedure. the other options, such as bisacodyl tablets, glycerine suppository, lactulose syrup, and senna tablets, are also laxatives but are less effective for bowel preparation and may not provide adequate cleansing of the colon.",ans: d
1642. a 19yo woman has had progressive bilateral iliac fossa pain and dyspareunia for 3days. she has an offensive vaginal discharge and feels unwell and feverish. her temp=39c. an initial antimicrobial regimen is commenced. what single set of organisms are the most appropriate for the antimicrobial regimen to cover?,a. neisseria gonorrhoeae and candida albicans,b. neisseria gonorrhoeae and candida albicans and gardnerellavaginalia,c. neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis,d. neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis and candida albicans,e. neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis and gardnerellavaginalis,,,,,,,"chat: neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis are common sexually transmitted infections that can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) in women, which can present with lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge. it is important to treat both infections with appropriate antibiotics to prevent complications such as infertility and chronic pelvic pain. the other options include additional organisms that may be associated with vaginal infections but are less likely to cause pid or require specific treatment.",ans: c
1643. a 48yo man with renal cancer had radiotherapy for metastatic spinal cord compression at the 11th thoracic vertebra 4wks ago. he has retained sensation but is unable to stand. he has pain in a band around his lower trunk controlled by regular oral morphine. he is distressed by increasingly frequent episodes of painful muscle spasms in his right leg. what is the single most appropriate management of his symptoms?,a. amitriptyline,b. baclofen,c. fentanyl patch,d. gabapentin,e. increase morphine dose,,,,,,,"chat: baclofen is the most appropriate management of painful muscle spasms in this patient with spinal cord compression. it is a muscle relaxant that acts on the spinal cord to reduce spasticity and painful spasms. amitriptyline, fentanyl patch, gabapentin, and increasing morphine dose may help with pain management, but are unlikely to address the spasms. note: this patient's symptoms require urgent medical attention, and prompt referral to a specialist palliative care team is recommended.",ans: b
"1644. a 4yo girl has had a temp=38.5c for 2days and has not wanted to eat her food. yesterday she developed a sore throat and small, painful ulcers inside her mouth. today she has small blisters on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet which are painful but not itchy. what is the single most likely underlying cause?",a. coxsackie virus,b. herpes simplex virus,c. staphylococcus aureus,d. streptococcus pneumonia,e. varicella zoster virus,,,,,,,"chat: yes, the key is a: coxsackie virus. hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral illness caused by the coxsackievirus. the symptoms described in the scenario are characteristic of this illness, including the fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers, and blisters on the palms and soles of the feet. treatment is primarily supportive, aimed at reducing fever and relieving pain. antibiotics are not effective against viral infections, and there is no specific treatment for coxsackievirus infection.",ans: a
1645. a 32yo woman has had 3 episodes of slurred speech and 2 episodes of transient weakness of both legs in the past 5yrs. each episode has resolved in 3m. what is the single most likely dx?,a. meningioma,b. migraine,c. multiple sclerosis,d. stroke,e. transient ischaemic attack,,,,,,,"chat: the presentation of multiple episodes of transient neurological symptoms that resolve spontaneously is highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis, which is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. the symptoms described are typical of relapsing-remitting ms, which is the most common type of ms. meningioma, migraine, stroke, and transient ischemic attack are all possible differential diagnoses, but ms is the most likely given the patient's age, sex, and clinical presentation.",ans: c
1646. an 8yo girl is complying with her asthma treatment of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid prophylaxis and short-acting bronchodilators as required. her inhaler technique is good. she now has a frequent night cough and mild exercise-induced wheeze. what would be the single most appropriate change in her treatment?,a. add leukotriene antagonist,b. add oral theophylline,c. add regular long-acting bronchodilator,d. increase dose of inhaled corticosteroid,e. short course of oral corticosteroid,,,,,,,"chat: adding a regular long-acting bronchodilator would be the most appropriate change in treatment for a child with mild exercise-induced wheeze and frequent night cough despite compliance with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and good inhaler technique. the long-acting bronchodilator would provide additional bronchodilation and improve control of symptoms. adding a leukotriene antagonist or short course of oral corticosteroid may also be considered in certain cases, but adding a regular long-acting bronchodilator would be the most appropriate initial step. adding oral theophylline is not recommended in current guidelines for the management of childhood asthma.",ans: c
1647. a 38yo man with longstanding alcohol dependence has vertigo and a tremor every morning. what is the single most likely dx?,a. anxiety,b. benign positional vertigo,c. cerebellar degeneration,d. optic neuritis,e. temporal lobe epilepsy,,,,,,,"chat: chronic alcoholism can lead to cerebellar degeneration, which may cause symptoms such as vertigo and tremors. option a (anxiety) may be a possible contributing factor but not the single most likely diagnosis. option b (benign positional vertigo) may cause vertigo but not usually tremors. option d (optic neuritis) is a condition that affects the optic nerve and may cause visual disturbances, but not typically vertigo and tremors. option e (temporal lobe epilepsy) can cause seizures and other neurological symptoms, but is less likely to be the cause of these specific symptoms in this patient.",ans: c
1648. an 84yo woman with alzheimer's dementia has recently become incontinent and more confused than usual. what is the single most likely dx?,a. detrusor overactivity,b. neuropathic bladder,c. nocturnal enuresis,d. uti,e. uterine prolapse,,,,,,,"chat: that is correct. in elderly patients with dementia, urinary tract infections (utis) are a common cause of new-onset or worsening urinary incontinence and confusion. utis may also present without classic symptoms such as dysuria or fever, making it important to consider this diagnosis in any elderly patient with altered mental status or incontinence. the other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms. detrusor overactivity and neuropathic bladder are possible causes of urinary incontinence, but are less likely given the patient's age and sudden onset of symptoms. nocturnal enuresis is unlikely given the patient's age, and uterine prolapse is unlikely to cause sudden onset of symptoms in this patient.",ans: d
"1649. a 4yo boy complains of pain around his right eye. he is unwell, febrile and also suffers from pain on the right side of his face. what is the most probable dx?",a. allergic reaction,b. furuncle,c. folliculitis,d. foreign body,e. periorbital cellulitis,,,,,,,"chat: periorbital cellulitis is the most probable diagnosis in this case because the patient is unwell, febrile, and complaining of pain around the right eye and on the right side of his face, which are all common symptoms of this condition. periorbital cellulitis is an infection of the eyelid and surrounding skin, and is a common cause of acute onset of fever and orbital pain in children. other options such as allergic reaction, furuncle, folliculitis, and foreign body are less likely to cause these specific symptoms.",ans: e
1650. a pt presents with irregularly irregular pulse of 162bpm. what drug is most useful initially?,a. amiodarone,b. digoxin,c. bisoprolol,d. warfarin,e. heparin,,,,,,,"chat: bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that can be used for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation. it is a first-line option for acute management of atrial fibrillation along with other drugs like verapamil. digoxin and amiodarone can be used as second-line options. warfarin and heparin are anticoagulants and are not directly indicated for the acute management of atrial fibrillation, although they may be necessary for stroke prevention in some patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.",ans: c
"1651. a 59yo man has shown a change in his mood and personality over a 9m period. he has subsequently developed difficulty with memory and conc, and then progressive fidgety movements of his limbs and facial musculature. by the time of medical assessment he has frank choreiform movements and a mini-mental state exam of 21/30. other exam is normal. he was adopted and therefore no information on his famhx is available. he has 3 adult children (27, 30, 33) of whom the 2 youngest are asymptomatic. however, the oldest son has recently been inv by the neurology dept for slightly erratic behavior and fidgety restless movements of both legs. based on the likely clinical dx, which one of the following genetic patterns is most likely?",a. ad inheritance with anticipation,b. ad with variable penetrance,c. ar,d. x-linked,e. mitochondrial disorder,,,,,,,"chat: huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with anticipation, which means that the age of onset of symptoms decreases and the severity increases with each generation. the disease is caused by an expansion of cag repeats in the huntingtin gene. the other options are unlikely because they do not fit with the clinical presentation of the patient or the known genetics of huntington's disease.",ans: a
1652. a 35yo pt has been dx with schizophrenia. he mimics the doctors and attendants – doing the same physical actions as them. what symptom does this pt have?,a. echopraxia,b. echolalia,c. perseveration,d. apraxia,e. anosognosia,,,,,,,"chat: the key is a. echopraxia. [echopraxia is the involuntary repetition or imitation of another person's actions. similar to echolalia, which is the involuntary repetition of sounds and language. echopraxia has long been recognized as a core feature of tourette syndrome, and is considered a complex tic, but it also occurs in autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and catatonia]. other options are wrong because: echolalia (b) is the involuntary repetition of words or phrases spoken by another person. perseveration (c) is the repetition of a particular response or behavior despite the absence or cessation of a stimulus. apraxia (d) is the inability to perform purposeful movements despite having the desire and physical ability to perform them. anosognosia (e) is the lack of awareness or insight into one's own illness or condition.",ans: a
1653. a pt has loss of sensation on the tip of her tongue and the inner aspect of the lip. which nerve is most likely to be involved?,a. vagus nerve,b. glossopharyngeal nerve,c. lingual nerve,d. buccal nerve,e. facial nerve,,,,,,,"chat: the lingual nerve is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (cn v3) that provides sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the lingual gingiva (inner aspect of the gum). therefore, loss of sensation on the tip of the tongue and the inner aspect of the lip suggests involvement of the lingual nerve. options a (vagus nerve), b (glossopharyngeal nerve), d (buccal nerve), and e (facial nerve) do not innervate these areas.",ans: c
1654. a 51yo woman complains of difficulty swallowing and also reddish dots on her skin. a pic of her hand is seen. what is the most appropriate term for the condition you would expect to see?,a. sclerodactyly,b. ra,c. swan neck deformity,d. polydactyly,e. ulnar deformity,,,,,,,"chat: sclerodactyly is a condition characterized by thickening and tightening of the skin of the fingers and hands, resulting in a shiny, smooth appearance. it is commonly seen in patients with systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma. the reddish dots on the skin mentioned in the question could be telangiectasias, another common feature of systemic sclerosis. option b, ra (rheumatoid arthritis), is a condition that can cause joint pain and swelling, but it typically does not affect the skin in the way described in the question. option c, swan neck deformity, is a deformity of the finger commonly seen in patients with ra. option d, polydactyly, is a congenital condition where a person has extra fingers or toes. option e, ulnar deformity, is a nonspecific term and could refer to a range of conditions affecting the ulnar side of the hand or wrist. none of the options except for a are specifically associated with the features described in the question.",ans: a
1655. a 37yo female working as a healthcare assistant in a nursing home comes to the ed with complaints of severe itching all over her body. on asking she replies that she had applied cream on the body of a resident in the nursing home who had similar itches. what is the mechanism of itching?,a. allergic reaction,b. inflammation of keratinocytes,c. allergic reaction developed due to use of topical steroid creams,d. subcutaneous bleeding,e. none,,,,,,,"chat: the most likely mechanism of itching in this scenario is an allergic reaction. the healthcare assistant may have come into contact with an allergen while applying the cream to the resident, which then caused an allergic reaction in her own body, leading to itching. option b (inflammation of keratinocytes) is not typically associated with itching. option c (allergic reaction due to use of topical steroid creams) is a possibility but not supported by the given information. option d (subcutaneous bleeding) is unlikely to be the cause of itching. option e (none) is not a valid answer as there must be a reason for the itching.",ans: a
"1656. a 65yo pt who had mi 1yr ago now comes to the ed complaining that his neighbor is conspiring against him. when his son is asked, he denies it and also narrates that sometimes his father says that everybody in his office is always talking about him, which is not the case. what is the most appropriate med?",a. tca,b. clozapine,c. olanzapine,d. lorazepam,,,,,,,,"chat: the diagnosis in this case is unclear, but the most appropriate medication choice given the patient's symptoms would be an antipsychotic medication. among the options provided, olanzapine would be the most appropriate choice as it is effective for treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia, which can include delusions and hallucinations. tca (tricyclic antidepressants) are not indicated for the treatment of psychotic disorders, and clozapine is typically reserved for treatment-resistant cases. lorazepam is a benzodiazepine and may be used for acute anxiety or agitation, but it would not be the first-line treatment for psychotic symptoms.",ans: c
"1657. you suspect cushing's disease in a 50yo woman who has attended clinic with glycosuria, htn and a suggestive body habitus. initial inv point you towards a dx of cushing's disease. which of the following findings would be against this dx?",a. a normal 8am cortisol,b. failure to suppress morning cortisol with dexamethasone,c. htn requiring >2 antihypertensive agents,d. impaired growth hormone response to glucose loading,e. unilateral adrenal enlargement,,,,,,,"chat: the finding that would be against the diagnosis of cushing's disease in a 50-year-old woman with suggestive clinical features is unilateral adrenal enlargement, as described in option e. cushing's disease is a condition caused by a pituitary adenoma that secretes excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol. therefore, a normal 8am cortisol level and a failure to suppress morning cortisol with dexamethasone, as described in option a and b respectively, are consistent with the diagnosis of cushing's disease. option c, htn requiring >2 antihypertensive agents, is a common finding in patients with cushing's disease, as excess cortisol can lead to hypertension. option d, impaired growth hormone response to glucose loading, is not specific to cushing's disease and could be seen in a variety of other endocrine disorders. option e, unilateral adrenal enlargement, is not consistent with the diagnosis of cushing's disease, which is typically caused by bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. unilateral adrenal enlargement could be seen in other conditions, such as an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. therefore, the correct answer is e, unilateral adrenal enlargement, which would be against the diagnosis of cushing's disease in this patient.",ans: d
"1658. which finding, on clinical examination of the pulse, suggests a diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (hocm)?",a. irregularly irregular pulse suggesting a-fib,b. pulsusalternans,c. pulsusbigeminus,d. pulsusbisferiens,e. pulsusparadoxus,,,,,,,"chat: the finding on clinical examination of the pulse that suggests a diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (hocm) is pulsus bisferiens, as described in option d. pulsus bisferiens is a sign where, on palpation of the pulse, a double peak per cardiac cycle can be appreciated. this is due to the combination of a rapidly rising and a slowly rising component of the arterial pulse, which gives the impression of two distinct beats. the other options are incorrect. option a, irregularly irregular pulse suggesting atrial fibrillation, is a sign of an arrhythmia, but it is not specific to hocm. option b, pulsus alternans, is an alternating strong and weak pulse, and is not typically associated with hocm. option c, pulsus bigeminus, is a type of pulse rhythm where there is a pattern of every other heartbeat being premature, and is not typically associated with hocm. option e, pulsus paradoxus, is a decrease in pulse amplitude during inspiration, and is more commonly associated with cardiac tamponade or severe asthma, rather than hocm. therefore, the correct answer is d, pulsus bisferiens, which is a characteristic finding in hocm.",ans: d
"1659. a 60yo male is admitted with a 2d hx of lower abdominal pain and marked vomiting. on examination he has abdominal swelling, guarding and numerous audible bowel sounds. what is the likely dx?",a. gallstone ileus,b. ischemic colitis,c. large bowel obstruction,d. sigmoid volvulus,e. small bowel obstruction,,,,,,,"chat: the likely diagnosis in this case is sigmoid volvulus, as indicated by the presence of abdominal swelling, guarding, and numerous audible bowel sounds. sigmoid volvulus occurs when the sigmoid colon twists upon itself, causing obstruction of the bowel. the lower abdominal pain and vomiting are consistent with this diagnosis. ischemic colitis, another option, typically presents with abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and tenderness to palpation, but not necessarily with bowel sounds, making option b incorrect. gallstone ileus is a rare complication of gallstones that can cause bowel obstruction, but it usually presents with absence of bowel sounds and crampy abdominal pain, making option a incorrect. large bowel obstruction is a possibility, but the location of the pain and the presence of audible bowel sounds make sigmoid volvulus more likely, making option c incorrect. small bowel obstruction typically presents with central abdominal pain, not lower abdominal pain, making option e incorrect. therefore, the correct answer is d, sigmoid volvulus.",ans: d
1660. a 17-year-old boy is diagnosed with scabies. which of the following statements regarding scabies is correct?,a. is best treated by salicylate emulsion,b. it can be spread by a droplet infection,c. it causes itchiness in the skin even where there is no obvious lesion to be seen,d. it is caused by staphylococcus aureus,e. typically affects the face,,,,,,,"chat: scabies is a parasitic infestation caused by the mite sarcoptes scabiei. it is typically spread by direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person, and not through droplet infection, making option b incorrect. the infestation causes intense itching, which is typically worse at night, and can affect any part of the body, including the genital area, making option e incorrect. the hallmark symptom of scabies is the presence of burrows, which are small, raised, grayish-white or flesh-colored lines on the skin surface, and not the presence of obvious lesions, making option a incorrect. salicylate emulsion is not the best treatment for scabies; the recommended treatment is a topical scabicide such as permethrin or lindane. option d is incorrect because staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria, and not the cause of scabies infestation. therefore, the correct answer is c, as itching is a common symptom of scabies, and can occur even in areas where there are no visible skin lesions.",ans: c
1661. an anemic young man is found to have a macrocytosis of 90%. the most likely cause is?,a. zieve’s syndrome,b. thalassemia minor,c. chronic renal disease,d. ida,e. folate def,f. chronic liver disease,g. hus,h. cytotoxic chemotherapy,i. phenytoin,,,"chat: thalassemia minor typically presents with a microcytic anemia, not macrocytosis. chronic renal disease and chronic liver disease can both cause anemia, but macrocytosis is not a characteristic finding. ida (iron deficiency anemia) can present with microcytosis, not macrocytosis. hus (hemolytic uremic syndrome) is a rare disorder that is characterized by the breakup of red blood cells and the formation of small blood clots in blood vessels throughout the body, leading to kidney failure, anemia, and a low platelet count. this condition is not typically associated with macrocytosis. cytotoxic chemotherapy and phenytoin can cause macrocytosis, but in this case, the most likely cause is folate deficiency. folate is required for dna synthesis and red blood cell production, and a deficiency can lead to macrocytosis.",ans: e
1662. an association with hpv is a most characteristic feature of?,a. torus,b. exostosis,c. pleomorphic adenoma,d. verruca vulgaris,e. fibroma,f. epulis fissuratum,g. mucocele,h. pyogenic granuloma,i. parulis,j. ranula,,chat: the key is d. verruca vulgaris. [it is most commonly associated with warts or verruca vulgaris].,ans: d
1663. for the following type of surgery what is the most likely agent that may cause post-operative infection -- aorto-iliofemoral reconstruction with a dacron vascular prosthesis?,a. proteus,b. e.coli,c. bacteroides fragilis,d. staphylococcus aureus,e. staphylococcus epidermis,f. c.perfringens,g. pseudomonas aeruginosa,h. streptococcus fecalis,i. streptococcus pneumonia,j. brucella melitensis,,"chat: while staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of infections in vascular prostheses, the specific answer to this question may vary based on geographical location and local patterns of infection. other organisms such as s. aureus, enterococci, and pseudomonas aeruginosa may also cause post-operative infections in this setting.",ans: e
"1664. a primigravida in the 17th week of her symptomless gestation is found, on us, to have evidence of placental tissue covering the cervical os. by the end of her pregnancy she is likely to develop?",a. placental migration,b. uterine myoma,c. uterine rupture,d. choriocarcinoma,e. chorangioma,f. vasa previa,g. subplacental abruption,h. subchorionic abruption,i. placenta accrete,j. placenta previa,,"chat: placental migration is a common occurrence in pregnancy, where the placenta moves away from the cervical os as the uterus grows, and allows for a safe vaginal delivery. placenta previa, on the other hand, is a condition where the placenta covers the cervical os and can cause bleeding during pregnancy and delivery. the other options are not related to placental position or location.",ans: a
1665. an elderly lady with copd has chronic sob. she is listed for cataract extraction. what is the anaesthetic of choice?,a. facial nerve block,b. bupivacaine infiltration of the,c. iv midazolam,d. peribulbar acupuncture,e. peribulbar lignocaine,f. topical xylocaine,g. iv alfentanil,h. epidural anesthesia,i. general anesthesia,j. retrobulbar xylocaine inj,,"chat: i agree with the answer. peribulbar anesthesia with a mixture of local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, or ropivacaine) and hyaluronidase is a common technique for cataract extraction in patients with copd. this technique provides excellent analgesia and akinesia of the globe, while avoiding the risks of general anesthesia, such as respiratory depression. other options listed are either not suitable or not commonly used for cataract extraction.",ans: e
1666. a 55yo chronic alcoholic with known hepatic cirrhosis has been on a heavy bout of alcohol the night before and was brought home by friends after falling several times in the pub. while being taken up the stairs to his bedroom he falls down the flight of 5 steps but sustains no obvious injuiry. his wife calls the ed the next day because she could not rouse him in the morning. he is brought in in a comatose state and both pupils appear dilated. skull vault xr appears normal.,a. hepatic encephalopathy,b. intracerebral hematoma,c. brain stem injury,d. extradural hematoma,e. chronic subdural hemorrhage,f. despressed skull fx,g. vertibrobasilar ischemia,h. acute subdural hematoma,i. sah,j. severe migraine attack,,,ans: h

(brocas area). [production (broca's) dysphasia/aphasia - lesions are located in the left pre-central areas. this is a non-fluent or expressive aphasia since there are deficits in speech production, prosody and syntactic comprehension. patients will typically exhibit slow and halting speech but with good semantic content. comprehension is usually good. unlike wernicke's aphasia, broca's patients are aware of their language difficulties. prosody is the study of the meter of verse. here it means the rhythm of speech. sensory (wernicke's) dysphasia/aphasia - lesions are located in the left posterior perisylvian region and primary symptoms are general comprehension deficits, word retrieval deficits and semantic paraphasias. lesions in this area damage the semantic content of language while leaving the language production function intact. the consequence is a fluent or receptive aphasia in which speech is fluent but lacking in content. patients lack awareness of their speech difficulties. semantics is the meaning of words. semantic paraphrasia is the substitution of a semantically related but incorrect word].",ans: h

1690. a pregnant woman in an early stage of labour expresses the wish to have pain relief during labour. the anesthetist describes that if the patient wishes he can use medication as a local anesthetic to block the pain sensations of labour. into which space should the local anaesthetic be normally injected?,a. anterior pararenal space,b. aryepiglottic space,c. vestibule space,d. epidural space,e. sub-arachnoid space,f. space of disse,g. middle ear,h. posterior pararenal space,i. supraglottic space,j. lesser sac,,"chat: during labor, local anesthesia is usually injected into the epidural space to block pain sensations. the epidural space is located between the vertebrae and the spinal cord. injecting anesthesia into this space numbs the nerves that transmit pain signals from the uterus and cervix to the brain. the other options are not correct for the following reasons: anterior pararenal space is located between the peritoneum and the abdominal fascia and is not related to labor pain relief. aryepiglottic space is a part of the upper respiratory tract and is not related to labor pain relief. vestibule space is a part of the female genitalia and is not related to labor pain relief. sub-arachnoid space is located below the arachnoid membrane and contains cerebrospinal fluid; this space is typically used for spinal anesthesia, not epidural anesthesia. space of disse is located between liver cells and is not related to labor pain relief. middle ear is a part of the ear and is not related to labor pain relief. posterior pararenal space is located behind the peritoneum and is not related to labor pain relief. supraglottic space is a part of the upper respiratory tract and is not related to labor pain relief. lesser sac is a part of the abdominal cavity and is not related to labor pain relief.",ans: d
1691. a 29yo afro-caribbean man presents with a non-productive cough mild aches in the ankles. the symptoms have been present for 2m. his esr is elevated. ca: 2.69 mmol/l; po4 -: 1.20 mmol/l; alp: 80 iu/l. serum 25(oh) d: 180 nmol/l normal values for calcium: 2.12-2.65mmol/l; phosphate: 0.8-1.45mmol/l; alp 30-300iu/l; serum 25(oh) d: 20-105nmol/l; urea: 2.5-6.7mmol/l; creatinine: 70-120μmol/l,a. osteoporosis,b. thiazide diuretics,c. skeletal metastases,d. primary hyperparathyroidism,e. hypoparathyroidism,f. osteomalacia,g. multiple myeloma,h. paget's disease of bone,i. sarcoidosis,j. hyperthyroidism,,"chat: the patient's presentation is consistent with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organ systems including the lungs, skin, and bones. the elevated esr and mild ankle pain suggest an inflammatory process, and the high calcium level is likely due to excess activation of vitamin d by the granulomatous inflammation of sarcoidosis. the other options listed are less likely given the patient's presentation and laboratory values. osteoporosis typically does not cause hypercalcemia, and thiazide diuretics would be an unlikely cause in a young patient with no history of hypertension. skeletal metastases and multiple myeloma would be unlikely without a history of cancer, and primary hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism would not cause the elevated serum 25(oh) d level. paget's disease of bone typically presents with localized bone pain and deformity, while osteomalacia would typically cause a low serum calcium level. hyperthyroidism can cause hypercalcemia, but it is not supported by the patient's laboratory values or symptoms.",ans: i
1692. a 22yo has had recent chickenpox. he now presents with confusion. he is noted to have low urine output and large petechiae all over his body. cxr: a large patch of consolidation is seen. the management of choice should be :,a. ventilatory support,b. open surgical debridement,c. resection of superficial,d. booster vaccine,e. tens,f. lontophoresis,g. nephrostomy,h. oral corticosteroids,i. brivudin,j. iv acyclovir,,"chat: the clinical scenario described suggests a severe case of varicella-zoster virus infection, which can cause complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic manifestations. the presence of confusion and low urine output indicates possible involvement of the central nervous system and kidneys, respectively. the large petechiae suggest thrombocytopenia, which can be a complication of varicella infection. the cxr finding of a large patch of consolidation suggests the presence of pneumonia. the management of choice in this case is iv acyclovir, an antiviral medication that is effective against varicella-zoster virus. ventilatory support may be necessary in severe cases of pneumonia, but it is not the primary management for this condition. open surgical debridement, resection of superficial petechiae, tens, lontophoresis, and nephrostomy are not indicated in this scenario. booster vaccine is not effective in treating an acute infection. oral corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for the treatment of varicella-zoster virus infection. brivudin is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes zoster infection, but it is not the first-line treatment for varicella-zoster virus infection.",ans: j
1693. a young girl with a psychiatric hx on med tx is brought to the dermatologist by her mother because of recurrent patchy hair loss. exam: the hair shafts revealed twisting and fractures. this suggests the following pathology:,a. infection with trichophyton tonsurans,b. infection with microsporum canis,c. alopecia areata,d. telogen effluvium,e. androgenetic alopecia,f. lichen planus,g. traction alopecia,h. alopecia totalis,i. trichorrhexis nodosa,j. trichotillomania,,"chat: trichotillomania is a disorder characterized by recurrent hair pulling, resulting in noticeable hair loss. the twisting and fractures seen in the hair shafts are consistent with the repetitive pulling and twisting motions associated with this disorder. the other options are less likely given the clinical scenario described. infections with trichophyton tonsurans or microsporum canis are common causes of tinea capitis but would not result in twisting and fractures of the hair shafts. alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, and androgenetic alopecia are typically not associated with hair shaft abnormalities. lichen planus is a skin disorder that can affect the scalp and cause hair loss, but it does not typically cause twisting and fractures of the hair shafts. traction alopecia is a form of hair loss caused by repetitive pulling or tension on the hair, but it typically occurs in areas of the scalp where hair is repeatedly pulled tight, such as from braiding or ponytails. alopecia totalis is a condition characterized by complete hair loss on the scalp, but it is not typically associated with twisting and fractures of the hair shafts. trichorrhexis nodosa is a condition characterized by fragile, brittle hair that breaks easily, but it does not typically result in twisting and fractures of the hair shafts.",ans: j
1694. syphilis typically causes,a. lymphogranuloma venereum,b. testicular torsion,c. hydrocele,d. epididymitis,e. seminoma,f. mature teratoma,g. varicocele,h. lymphoma,i. orchitis,j. spermatocele,,"chat: syphilis can cause orchitis, which is inflammation of the testicle. this can occur during the secondary or early latent stage of syphilis. lymphogranuloma venereum is caused by a different bacteria, chlamydia trachomatis, and can cause swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin area. testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord that causes a loss of blood flow to the testicle, leading to severe pain and potential loss of the testicle. hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac around the testicle. epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, a coiled tube at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. seminoma and mature teratoma are types of testicular cancer. varicocele is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum. lymphoma is a cancer that starts in cells that are part of the body's immune system. spermatocele is a cyst that develops in the epididymis and contains sperm.",ans: i
1695. a middle aged woman has severe collapse of the right femoral head requiring replacement. the removed femoral head is sent for pathology and is found to contain enlarged fat cells. the pathologist explains that this is the likely cause of the patient's femoral head collapse. a likely aetiology is,a. septic emboli,b. impaired venous drainage,c. hgb ss disease,d. steroid use,e. alcoholism,f. gaucher's disease,g. missed fracture,h. cushing's disease,i. radiation,j. vasculitis,,"chat: gaucher's disease is a genetic disorder in which a fatty substance (lipid) accumulates in cells and orgkey: it can affect bone health and increase the risk of bone fractures and joint damage, including femoral head collapse. this is due to the infiltration of lipid-laden macrophages into the bone marrow, leading to impaired bone remodeling and weakening of the bone structure. septic emboli, impaired venous drainage, steroid use, alcoholism, missed fracture, cushing's disease, radiation, and vasculitis are not typically associated with femoral head collapse in gaucher's disease.",ans: f
"1696. a 7yo boy with frequent episodic asthma is on tx with sodium cromoglycate. his physician wants to add a non-steroid preventer. the mother of the boy, a teacher, has just read about a nonsteroidal medication which acts on the mast cells, stopping them from releasing harmful chemicals. her physician agrees to add this medication to the boy's drug regimen. which medication is the physician most likely to add to the boy's treatment?",a. inhaled short acting,b. sc adrenaline,c. nedocromil sodium,d. inhaled long acting,e. inhaled sodium cromoglycate,f. inhaled steroids,g. inhaled saba,h. oral steroids,i. nebulised bronchodilators,j. oral theophylline,,chat: nedocromil sodium is a non-steroidal medication that acts on mast cells to prevent them from releasing harmful chemicals that cause asthma symptoms. it is used as a preventer medication in the treatment of asthma,ans: c
"1697. a 3yo boy is playing with his brother when he falls. he cries immediately and refuses to walk. his mother carries him to hospital. he had a full term nvd with no neonatal complications. his immunisations are up to date. exam: looks well and well-nourished, no dysmorphic features. he has slight swelling, warmth and discomfort on the lower 1/3 of the left tibia, and refuses to weight bear. ap and lateral x rays of the tibia are normal. what is the most likely dx?",a. ankle fx,b. ankle sprain,c. fibular fx,d. knee dislocation,e. tibial fx,,,,,,,"chat: correct, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a toddler's fracture, which is an undisplaced spiral fracture of the tibial shaft that often occurs in young children after minimal trauma and may not be visible on initial x-rays. the other options are less likely given the history and physical exam findings, and the normal x-rays. an ankle or fibular fracture would likely be visible on x-ray, and knee dislocation would present with more significant joint deformity and instability. an ankle sprain would not typically cause a non-weight-bearing limp.",ans: e
1698. which one of the following electrocardiographic changes is found in hypercalcaemia?,a. increased qrs interval,b. prolonged q-t interval,c. short p-r interval,d. short q-t interval,,,,,,,,chat: that is correct! hypercalcemia can lead to a shortening of the q-t interval on ecg due to a shortened st segment. this is because calcium plays an important role in the repolarization of cardiac cells. a shortened q-t interval can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias. the other options are not typically associated with hypercalcemia. an increased qrs interval may be seen in conditions such as bundle branch block or ventricular hypertrophy. a prolonged q-t interval may be seen in conditions such as electrolyte abnormalities or certain medications. a short p-r interval may be seen in conditions such as wolff-parkinson-white syndrome.,ans: d
"1699. an elderly male pt with prior hx of hematemesis is having hx of long term use of aspirin and other drugs, now presents with severe epigastric pain, dysphagia and vomiting. he was connected to vital monitors which were not reassuring. what is the management?",a. oral antacids,b. iv ppi,c. oral ppi,d. endoscopy,e. analgesia,,,,,,,"chat: correct, the most appropriate management in this scenario is endoscopy, as the patient's history of hematemesis and current symptoms suggest an upper gastrointestinal bleed, likely from a peptic ulcer caused by the long-term use of aspirin and other drugs. oral antacids or oral ppi may not be effective in stopping the bleed, and iv ppi is a reasonable option but should not be delayed while waiting for endoscopy. analgesia should be used with caution as it may mask symptoms of worsening bleeding.",ans: d
"1700. a 68yo man presents with bruising and hx of falls. he is found to have a mask-like face, pillrolling tremor and shuffling gait. eeg=normal. which of the following conditions is he most likely being treated for?",a. htn,b. dm,c. psychosis,d. tia,e. complex partial seizure,,,,,,,"chat: i'm sorry, but the key provided for this question is incorrect. parkinsonism, which is characterized by a mask-like face, pillrolling tremor, and shuffling gait, is not a side effect of antipsychotic medications but is a symptom of parkinson's disease. therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the information given, as none of the options are specific to parkinson's disease. however, given the presence of psychosis, it is possible that the patient is being treated for a condition such as schizophrenia, which may be managed with antipsychotic medications.",ans: c
"1701. a 45yo woman presents with easy fatigability, even on no exertion, chronic headaches and body aches and severe physical and mental exhaustion. she has no underlying conditions and all inv are non-conclusive. what is the most likely dx?",a. somatization,b. chronic fatigure syndrome,c. polymyalgia rheumatic,d. gca,e. depression,,,,,,,"chat: that is correct! chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is a complex disorder characterized by profound fatigue that lasts for more than six months and is not improved by rest. other symptoms may include headaches, muscle and joint pain, and difficulty concentrating. the exact cause of cfs is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of factors, including immune system dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, and psychological stress. somatization disorder involves multiple unexplained physical symptoms, and is typically associated with significant psychological distress. polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are inflammatory conditions that can cause fatigue and body aches, but are typically associated with older age. depression can cause fatigue and other physical symptoms, but is typically associated with low mood and other psychological symptoms.",ans: b
"1702. a 23yo male presents to his gp 2wks after a rta concerned about increasing anxiety lethargy and headache. at the time he had a ct brain after banging his head on the steering wheel, which revealed no abnormality. 6m following this episode his symptoms have resolved. what did his original symptoms likely represent?",a. conversion disorder,b. ptsd,c. somatization disorder,d. gad,e. post-concussion syndrome,,,,,,,"chat: yes, that is correct. post-concussion syndrome is a common sequelae of traumatic brain injury (tbi) and can present with symptoms such as anxiety, lethargy, and headache, among others. the ct brain performed at the time of the rta may have been normal, but it is not uncommon for patients with tbi to have normal imaging studies in the acute setting. the other options listed are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.",ans: e
1703. a 34yo man had a 4mm ureteric stone which he passed in urine. this time he presents withh 3cm stone in the right kidney. single most appropriate treatment?,a. no treatment,b. eswl,c. laparotomy,d. observe,e. operative stone removal,,,,,,,"chat: the given key is incorrect. the correct answer should be b. eswl (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy). eswl is the preferred treatment for a 3cm stone in the kidney. operative stone removal (open or laparoscopic) is reserved for very large, complicated, or refractory stones. observation or no treatment is not appropriate for a stone of this size as it can lead to complications such as infection, kidney damage, and obstruction.",ans: b
"1704. an 18m girl who has had single uti is seen in the opd. she has fever and vomiting but these improved with course of trimethoprim. subsequently, mcug showed bilateral vesicoureteric reflux. single most appropriate mgmt?",a. prophylactic antibiotics,b. reassure,c. no treatment,d. ureteric surgery,,,,,,,,"chat: i agree that the provided answer key is incorrect. the most appropriate management for a child with bilateral vesicoureteric reflux (vur) who has had a single uti and has no other underlying abnormalities would be prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrent utis and avoid potential complications such as pyelonephritis and renal scarring. reassurance or no treatment is not appropriate for a child with vur and a history of uti. ureteric surgery may be considered in certain cases of vur, such as those with high-grade reflux or associated abnormalities, but is not the first-line management for a child with bilateral vur and a single uti.",ans: d
"1705.  a 22yo says she has taken about 40 tabs of paracetamol 3h ago. her hr=110bpm, bp=110/80mmhg and rr=22bpm. what’s the initial management?",a. activated charcoal,b. n-acetyl cysteine,c. gastric lavage,d. wait for 4h paracetamol level,,,,,,,,"chat: the initial management of paracetamol overdose is to obtain a blood level of paracetamol 4 hours post ingestion. this is to determine if the patient requires treatment with n-acetyl cysteine (nac), an antidote for paracetamol overdose. activated charcoal and gastric lavage are not recommended as they have no proven benefit in paracetamol overdose and may cause harm.",ans: d
"1706. a 35yo man skidded on a wet road while riding his motorbike at a speed of 70mph. he has a large hematoma on temporal scalp, some bruises on chest wall and abdomen and a deformed thigh. gcs 11/15. high flow oxygen via mask given. most immediate radiological inv required during initial resuscitation phase?",a. cxr,b. ct brain,c. ct abdomen,d. xr femur,,,,,,,,"chat: the answer is a. cxr (chest x-ray). in a trauma patient with multiple injuries, the most immediate radiological investigation required during the initial resuscitation phase is a chest x-ray. this is because chest injuries such as pneumothorax, hemothorax or other chest structure trauma may be life-threatening and require urgent attention. ct brain, ct abdomen, and xr femur may also be necessary, but they are not the most immediate investigations required for initial resuscitation.",ans: a
1707. a 4yo baby has a generalized tonic-clonic convulsions and fever of 39c. his mother informs you that this has happened 3-4 times ebfore. what is the most probable dx?,a. febrile convulsion,b. absence seizures,c. epilepsy,d. partial complex seizure,,,,,,,,"chat: the answer is a. febrile convulsion. febrile convulsions are the most common type of seizures in children aged 6 months to 5 years. they are usually caused by a rapid rise in body temperature and are not associated with any underlying brain pathology. the convulsion is typically generalized and lasts less than 15 minutes. the child's development and neurology are otherwise normal. the recurrence rate of febrile convulsions is high, but the prognosis is generally good. option b. absence seizures are characterized by brief episodes of impaired consciousness, usually lasting only a few seconds, and are associated with a blank stare. they are not typically associated with fever. option c. epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. while febrile convulsions are a type of epilepsy, they are typically benign and not associated with underlying brain pathology. option d. partial complex seizures are a type of focal seizure that can involve altered consciousness or loss of awareness. they are not typically associated with fever.",ans: a
