Question
"1. A 65yo man presents with painless hematuria, IVU is normal, prostate is mildly enlarged with mild frequency. What is the most appropriate next step?"

a. US Abdomen

b. Flexible cystoscopy

c. MRI

d. Nuclear imaging

e. PSA

Ans. The key is B. Flexible cystoscopy. [Painless hematuria in an elderly indicates carcinoma bladder for which flexible cystoscopy is done.

Here BEP is not advanced to cause hemorrhage. There is mild enlargement of prostate and mild symptoms of prostration and hemorrhage is unlikely at this initial stage of BEP which makes Bladder cancer as the likely cause of painless hematuria.

It is also less likely to be prostate cancer as symptoms of prostration are mild (indicates disease is not advanced). Moreover bleeding in cancer prostate is less common].



2. A 74yo smoker presented to his GP with cough and SOB. Exam revealed pigmentation of the oral

mucosa and also over the palms and soles. Tests show that he is diabetic and hypokalemic.

b. Conns disease

c. Ectopic ACTH

d. Cushings disease

e. Hypothyroidism

Ans. The key is C. Ectopic ACTH. [The patient is smoker and probably developed squamous cell lung cancer which is working as a tumour producing ectopic ACTH causing pigmentation. Resulting raised cortisole is leading to diabetes and hypokalemia (though small cell carcinoma is usual cause but squamous cell carcinoma can produce ectopic ACTH as paraneoplastic syndrome also)].



3. A 44yo woman has lost weight over 12 months. She has also noticed episodes where her heart

beats rapidly and strongly. She has a regular pulse rate of 90bpm. Her ECG shows sinus rhythm.

What is the most appropriate inv to be done?

a. Thyroid antibodies

b. TFT

c. ECG

d. Echocardiogram

e. Plasma glucose

Ans. The key is B. TFT. [The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation That is why there is no arrhythmia in between attacks. From the given option TFT is the appropriate test as thyrotoxycosis is a leading cause of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and this ladies weight loss also makes thyrotoxycosis as the probable cause here].



"4. A 79yo anorexic male complains of thirst and fatigue. He has symptoms of frequency, urgency"

and terminal dribbling. His urea and creatinine levels are high. His serum calcium is 1.9 and he is

a. BPH

b. Prostate carcinoma

c. Chronic pyelonephritis

d. Benign nephrosclerosis



Ans. The key is B. Prostate Carcinoma.

Explanation for Question no. 4:

"First to say in this case (almost all features goes in favour of prostatic carcinoma like- frequency, urgency and terminal dribbling are features of prostatism; Age, anorexia and anaemia are constitutional features of carcinoma prostate and it would be accurate presentation if it was hypercalcaemia. But given calcium level is of hypocalcaemic level and it is the main cause of discrepancy to this question). Renal failure from ureteral obstruction in carcinoma prostate is a common presentation. Thirst is a feature of hypercalcaemia (here may be erroneously calcium level is given in hypocalcaemic level ; probably a bad recall). Prostate biopsy is the confirmatory diagnosis and others like PSA is suggestive."

***There are some suggestion that Renal Failure may be the cause of hypocalcemia.

against the tx?

a. Fam hx

b. Tumor grading

c. LN involvement

d. Her age



Ans. The key is D. Her age. Probably wrong key. Correct key should be B. Tumour grading. [What ever the age oestrogen receptor positive patient will take tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy. But tumour grading in some instance may influence the need of adjuvant therapy. Though the given key is D it is probably a wrong key and correct key should be B. Tumour grading].

a. CT

b. MRI brain

c. Angiogram

d. Otoscopy



Ans. The key is B. MRI brain. [AC>BC indicate Rinne positive; i.e. The deafness is not conductive. Again hearing loss is on right side. Weber lateralized to left. We know weber lateralized to same side if conductive deafness and to opposite if there is sensoryneural deafness. So it is now obvious that the deafness of right ear is sensoryneural deafness for which MRI brain is the next best investigation].



"787. A 74yo lady called an ambulance for an acute chest pain. She has a hx of DM and HTN, and is a"

appropriate inv?

a. MSU

b. US abdomen

c. US KUB

d. Serum calcium

within a few hours. What is the most definitive inv for this condition?

a. Carotid Doppler

b. Angiography

c. CT head

d. Digoxin level

Ans. The key is B. Angiography. Probably wrong key! Correct key is C. CT head.

[Patient on digoxin means he is being yreated for atrial fibrillation with heart failure and the cause of tia is cardiac in origine! So carotid dopplar or carotid angiography is not the answer.

a. Hypothyroidism

b. Stress

c. Pregnancy

d. Prolactin secreting pituitary tumor

e. PCOS

"Ans. The key is D. Wrong key. Correct key should be A. Hypothyroidism. [ It is likely to be hypothyroidism because prolactin level in hypothyroidism may be 30-200ng/ml which means 630-4200 mIU/L. Though weight gain can occur but fatigue is not a feature of prolactinoma unless it is a macroadenoma causing suppression of other pituitary hormone! given prolactin level of 1100 IU/L is definitely from a microadenoma (in macroadenoma prolactin level is > 10,000 MU/L) which does not cause fatigue. So the case most likely seems to be hypothyroidism]."

As CSF can not differentia between meningitis and encephalitis we have to take help of imaging like MRI. In herpes simplex encephalitis there is characteristic hyperintensity in fronto-temporal region.
In the given case there are features of raised intracranial pressure like drowsiness and seizer and so we cannot proceed for LP unless guided by CT (or MRI). On the other hand there is no other option that can be diagnostic of the given condition. So we have to happy with CSF analysis as the key though at this moment we have to withheld this procedure].

"Ans. The key is C. insulin. [Insulin is devoid of significant side effect than Glitazones (like fluid retention). In renal failure there is reduced GFR and some fluid retention. It is not desirable that glitazone to cause more fluid retention by causing oedema. The oral agents that are thought to be relatively safe in patients with nondialysis CKD include short-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide) and repaglinide. If an oral agent is used, the short-acting sulfonylurea, glipizide, is the preferred agent among nondialysis CKD patients who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73. The dose for glipizide is 2.5 to 10 mg/day. Glyburide and other long-acting sulfonylureas are generally not recommended in any CKD patient with type 2 diabetes, because of the risk of hypoglycemia. Some clinicians recommend the use of the meglitinide repaglinide (starting with a dose of 0.5 mg) for nondialysis CKD patients since these agents are not renally cleared. Nondialysis CKD patients with type 2 diabetes may be treated with an oral agent, although many patients end up on insulin therapy because it is more effective.

"Ans. The key is B. Acute respiratory alkalosis. [In panic attack there occurs hyperventilation which causes washout of CO2 and leads to acute respiratory alkalosis resulting in raised pH >7.45 (here 7.52), low PCO2 (here 2.2 kPa) with compensatory decrease in HCO3 (here 20meq/l)]."



"956. A 65yo man on dexamethasone underwent surgery. During and after the surgery, his blood"

glucose was around 17-19mmol/l. What will you give the pt?

a. Insulin

b. Oral hypoglycemic

c. Remove dexamethasone

d. IV Saline

e. IX dextrose



"Ans. The key is D. IV saline. [It is estimated that adults secrete 75-150mg of cortisol in response to major surgery and 50mg a day for minor surgery, and secretion parallels duration and extent of surgery"

"Patients undergoing a surgical procedure or responding to stress, trauma, or an acute illness will exhibit an increase in adrenal cortisol production up to 6-fold normal levels. However, in patients on chronic exogenous steroid therapy, atrophy of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may occur through feedback inhibition, leading to an inability to respond to stress. It has historically been believed that patients receiving long-term corticosteroids require supplemental, perioperative doses, and that failure to provide such coverage in secondary adrenal insufficiency may lead to an adrenal crisis characterized by hypotension and cardiovascular collapse."

*** So who are telling remove dexamethason are wrong!!!***

"patients receiving “physiologic replacement” doses (<10 mg/ day) do not need additional steroids perioperatively beyond their standard regimen. Patients receiving doses exceeding the normal expected stress response for their surgery (>150 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for moderate/major surgery, or >50 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for minor surgery) also do not need additional coverage beyond their current therapy, because acute immunosuppressive doses are more than sufficient to maintain cardiovascular stability during the operation."

Regular daily dose of more than 10 mg prednisolone within the last three months:

i. Minor surgery: 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction

ii. Moderate surgery Usual pre-operative steroids

(Hysterectomy) + 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction

+ 100 mg hydrocortisone/day



iii. Major surgery Usual pre-operative steroids

"Major trauma, prolonged + 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction"

surgery + 100 mg hydrocortisone/day for 2 – 3 days



"Surgical patients commonly develop hyperglycemia related to the hypermetabolic stress response, which increases glucose production and causes insulin resistance. Although hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes, the treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin infusions has not provided consistent benefits. Despite early results, which suggested decreased mortality and other advantages of “tight” glucose control, later investigations found no benefit or increased mortality when hyperglycemia was aggressively treated with insulin. Because of these conflicting data, the optimal glucose concentration to improve outcomes in critically ill patients is unknown. There is agreement, however, that hypoglycemia is an undesirable complication of intensive insulin therapy and should be avoided. "

"So, “FOR PERIOPERATIVE HYPERGLYCEMIA NO NEED OF INSULIN” just IV saline!!!]."

[The time required for the egg to travel to the uterus and implant is usually between 7 and 10 days]. [There are two types of pill:
"1. 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel pill. It should be taken within 72 hours (three days). It is thought to work mainly by preventing or delaying the release of an egg from your ovary, which normally happens each month (ovulation)."
"2. Ulipristal acetate (brand name ellaOne®) is a type of emergency contraceptive pill that was launched in the UK in 2009. It is taken as one single tablet. Take the pill as soon as possible after unprotected sex. The earlier you take the pill, the more effective it is. It can be taken up to 120 hours (five days) after having unprotected sex. It is a type of hormone which seems to work by stopping or delaying release of an egg (ovulation)."
IUCD prevent implantation. As she is sexually active hymen is ruptured and IUCD can be given to her. But with IUCD chance of ectopic pregnancy is much more!].
