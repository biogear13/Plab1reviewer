[it is estimated that adults secrete 75-150mg of cortisol in response to major surgery and 50mg a day for minor surgery, and secretion parallels duration and extent of surgery patients undergoing a surgical procedure or responding to stress, trauma, or an acute illness will exhibit an increase in adrenal cortisol production up to 6-fold normal levels. however, in patients on chronic exogenous steroid therapy, atrophy of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis may occur through feedback inhibition, leading to an inability to respond to stress. it has historically been believed that patients receiving long-term corticosteroids require supplemental, perioperative doses, and that failure to provide such coverage in secondary adrenal insufficiency may lead to an adrenal crisis characterized by hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. *** so who are telling remove dexamethason are wrong!!!*** patients receiving “physiologic replacement” doses (<10 mg/ day) do not need additional steroids perioperatively beyond their standard regimen. patients receiving doses exceeding the normal expected stress response for their surgery (>150 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for moderate/major surgery, or >50 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for minor surgery) also do not need additional coverage beyond their current therapy, because acute immunosuppressive doses are more than sufficient to maintain cardiovascular stability during the operation. regular daily dose of more than 10 mg prednisolone within the last three months: i. minor surgery: 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction ii. moderate surgery usual pre-operative steroids (hysterectomy) + 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction + 100 mg hydrocortisone/day iii. major surgery usual pre-operative steroids major trauma, prolonged + 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction surgery + 100 mg hydrocortisone/day for 2 – 3 days surgical patients commonly develop hyperglycemia related to the hypermetabolic stress response, which increases glucose production and causes insulin resistance. although hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes, the treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin infusions has not provided consistent benefits. despite early results, which suggested decreased mortality and other advantages of “tight” glucose control, later investigations found no benefit or increased mortality when hyperglycemia was aggressively treated with insulin. because of these conflicting data, the optimal glucose concentration to improve outcomes in critically ill patients is unknown. there is agreement, however, that hypoglycemia is an undesirable complication of intensive insulin therapy and should be avoided.  so, “for perioperative hyperglycemia no need of insulin” just iv saline!!!]. 957. a 61yo man who had stroke 2y ago is on aspirin. he has ra but suffers from pain and can’t ",,,,
