# Plab1reviewer

I want to attempt to take the Plab 1 as a step for the accreditation of my medical degree here in the UK. It has been a decade since I studied clinical information and frankly I do not know where to start. Recently I got really interested in data analytics and python. This is me trying to connect the degree that I graduated from with my current skills and interests. In this project I aim to create a reviewer based on the 1700 plab question that I downloaded from the internet.
