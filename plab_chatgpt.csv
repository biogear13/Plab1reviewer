"1. 65yo man presents with painless hematuria, ivu is normal, prostate is mildly enlarged with mild frequency. what is the most appropriate next step?",a. us abdomen,b. flexible cystoscopy,c. mri,d. nuclear imaging,e. psa,,,,,,key: the key is b. flexible cystoscopy. [painless hematuria in an elderly (here 65 years old man) indicates carcinoma bladder for which flexible cystoscopy is done.here bep is not advanced to cause hemorrhage. there is mild enlargement of prostate and mild symptoms of prostration and hemorrhage is unlikely at this initial stage of bep which makes bladder cancer as the likely cause of painless hematuria.it is also less likely to be prostate cancer as symptoms of prostration are mild (indicates disease is not advanced). moreover bleeding in cancer prostate is less common].,"The most appropriate next step for a 65-year-old man presenting with painless hematuria, mildly enlarged prostate, and mild frequency is b. flexible cystoscopy. This is because painless hematuria in an elderly man is often indicative of bladder carcinoma, which can be confirmed or ruled out by a flexible cystoscopy procedure. At this initial stage of benign prostatic enlargement (BEP), hemorrhage is unlikely, and symptoms of prostration are mild, making bladder cancer a more likely cause of hematuria than prostate cancer. MRI, nuclear imaging, and PSA testing are not indicated in the initial assessment of painless hematuria with prostate symptoms and would not be useful in determining the cause of the bleeding. US abdomen may help diagnose certain conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step for this particular presentation.",b,b,TRUE,
2. 74yo smoker presented to his gp with cough and sob. exam revealed pigmentation of the oral mucosa and also over the palms and soles. tests show that he is diabetic and hypokalemic. what is the most probable dx?,a. pseudocushing syndrome,b. conns disease,c. ectopic acth,d. cushings disease,e. hypothyroidism,,,,,,key: the key is c. ectopic acth. [the patient is smoker and probably developed squamous cell lung cancer which is working as a tumour producing ectopic acth causing pigmentation. resulting raised cortisole is leading to diabetes and hypokalemia (though small cell carcinoma is usual cause but squamous cell carcinoma can produce ectopic acth as paraneoplastic syndrome also)].,"The most probable diagnosis for the 74-year-old smoker presenting with cough, shortness of breath, diabetic and hypokalemic symptoms, and pigmentation of oral mucosa and palms/soles is ectopic ACTH. The patient's presentation is consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome caused by squamous cell lung cancer, which can produce ectopic ACTH and lead to raised cortisol levels resulting in diabetes and hypokalemia. Pseudocushing syndrome, Conns disease, Cushing's disease, and hypothyroidism are all less likely diagnoses in this patient based on the given symptoms. Pseudocushing syndrome typically occurs in patients with depression and obesity, and Conns disease would present with high blood pressure, not respiratory symptoms. Cushing's disease occurs due to a pituitary tumor, and hypothyroidism would present with a low thyroid hormone level, not high cortisol levels as in Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is ectopic ACTH.",c,c,TRUE,
3. 44yo woman has lost weight over 12 months. she has also noticed episodes where her heart beats rapidly and strongly. she has a regular pulse rate of 90bpm. her ecg shows sinus rhythm. what is the most appropriate inv to be done?,a. thyroid antibodies,b. tft,c. ecg,d. echocardiogram,e. plasma glucose,,,,,,key: the key is b. tft. [the patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that is why there is no arrhythmia in between attacks. from the given option tft is the appropriate test as thyrotoxycosis is a leading cause of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and this ladies weight loss also makes thyrotoxycosis as the probable cause here].,"The correct answer is b. thyroid function test (TFT). This is because the patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is a type of irregular heart rate that occurs in episodes, and thyrotoxicosis is a leading cause of this condition. Additionally, the patient has experienced significant weight loss, which further suggests a possible thyroid condition. The other answer options are not as appropriate because thyroid antibodies would not provide information on thyroid function, ECG has already been performed and showed sinus rhythm, echocardiogram is not necessary because the patient is not presenting with heart failure symptoms, and plasma glucose is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, a TFT would be the most appropriate investigation to evaluate the patient's thyroid function and potentially diagnose thyrotoxicosis as the underlying cause for her symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
"4. 79yo anorexic male complains of thirst and fatigue. he has symptoms of frequency, urgency and terminal dribbling. his urea and creatinine levels are high. his serum calcium is 1.9 and he is anemic. his bp is 165/95 mmhg. what is the most probable dx?",a. bph,b. prostate carcinoma,c. chronic pyelonephritis,d. benign nephrosclerosis,,,,,,,"key: the key is b. prostate carcinoma. explanation for question no. 4: first to say in this case (almost all features goes in favour of prostatic carcinoma like-  frequency, urgency and terminal dribbling are features of prostatism; age, anorexia and anaemia are constitutional features of carcinoma prostate and it would be accurate presentation if it was hypercalcaemia. but given calcium level is of hypocalcaemic level and it is the main cause of discrepancy to this question). renal failure from ureteral obstruction in carcinoma prostate is a common presentation.  thirst is a feature of hypercalcaemia  (here may be erroneously calcium level is given in hypocalcaemic level ; probably a bad recall).  prostate biopsy is the confirmatory diagnosis and others like psa is suggestive. ***there are some suggestion that renal failure may be the cause of hypocalcemia.","The most probable diagnosis for this patient is prostate carcinoma (option b). This is because the patient presents with symptoms that are typical of prostatism, such as frequency, urgency, and terminal dribbling. In addition, constitutional symptoms like anorexia and anemia are also present, which are commonly associated with prostate carcinoma. The fact that the serum calcium level is lower than expected for hypercalcemia, and thirst is not a presenting symptom, is somewhat contradictory to hypercalcaemia, which is commonly seen in prostate carcinoma. However, renal failure from ureteral obstruction in carcinoma prostate is a common presentation which can affect calcium levels. Prostate biopsy is the confirmatory diagnosis, and PSA test can be suggestive. The other options (BPH, chronic pyelonephritis, and benign nephrosclerosis) are less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms and findings.",b,b,TRUE,
"5. 64yo man has recently suffered from an mi and is on aspirin, atorvastatin and ramipril. he has been having trouble sleeping and has been losing weight for the past 4 months. he doesn’t feel like doing anything he used to enjoy and has stopped socializing. he says he gets tired easily and can’t concentrate on anything. what is the most appropriate tx?",a. lofepramine,b. dosulepin,c. citalopram,d. fluoxetine,e. phenelzine,,,,,,key: the key is c. citalopram. [among ssris sertraline is the drug of choice for ischemic heart disease. next choice is citalopram (as it is often related to torsades de pointes it is not 1st choice). if ssri cannot be used mirtazapine is recommended as next antidepressant].,"The most appropriate treatment for the 64-year-old man suffering from weight loss, insomnia, anhedonia, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating after suffering from an MI and already on aspirin, atorvastatin, and ramipril would be citalopram. Sertraline is the preferred SSRI for MI, but citalopram is the next choice. Mirtazapine is recommended if an SSRI cannot be used, but it was not listed as a possible answer. Lofepramine and dosulepin are tricyclic antidepressants and should be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disease due to their cardiotoxic effects. Fluoxetine is not recommended in elderly patients since it has a long half-life and can cause drug interactions. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which has a high risk of hypertensive crisis and should be reserved for refractory cases. Therefore, citalopram is the most appropriate choice for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,
"6. 67yo man after a stroke, presents with left sided ptosis and constricted pupil. he also has loss of pain and temp on the right side of his body and left side of his face. which part of the brain is most likely affected?",a. frontal cortex,b. cerebellum,c. pons,d. medulla,e. parietal cortex,,,,,,key: the key is d. medulla. [the name of the condition is “lateral medullary syndrome” [ipsilateral horner syndrome and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense].,"The correct answer is D. Medulla. The condition that likely produced these symptoms is Lateral Medullary Syndrome, also known as Wallenberg Syndrome. The medulla is responsible for many crucial functions, including controlling vital signs, such as breathing and heart rate, and relaying sensory and motor information between the brain and the rest of the body. Damage to this area can result in a range of neurological symptoms, including Horner Syndrome (ptosis and constricted pupil on the same side as the neurological damage) and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side of the body. The other brain regions listed (frontal cortex, cerebellum, pons, parietal cortex) are not responsible for the specific symptoms described in the question. Therefore, they are not the correct answer.",d,d,TRUE,
7. 60yo man presents with dysphagia and pain on swallowing both solids and liquids. a barium meal shows gross dilatation of the esophagus with a smooth narrowing at the lower end of the esophagus. what is the single most likely cause of dysphagia?,a. achalasia,b. myasthenia gravis,c. esophageal carcinoma,d. esophageal web,e. systemic sclerosis,,,,,,key: the key is a. achalasia. [dysphagia for both solid and liquid or prominently liquid suggest achalasia where dysphagia to solid suggest stricture. also gross dilatation of oesophagus with smooth narrowing at lower end is seen in achalasia. in achalasia dysphagia is usually described as progressive].,"The single most likely cause of dysphagia in this 60-year-old man with pain on swallowing both solids and liquids, and gross dilatation of the esophagus with smooth narrowing at the lower end is achalasia. Dysphagia for both solid and liquid, or prominently liquid, is suggestive of achalasia, where dysphagia to solid suggests stricture. In achalasia, dysphagia is usually described as progressive. Myasthenia gravis may cause difficulty swallowing, but it typically affects skeletal muscle and not smooth muscle like in the esophagus. Esophageal carcinoma may cause dysphagia, but it usually involves a long history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Esophageal webs are typically seen in younger patients and may cause dysphagia to solids only. Systemic sclerosis may cause esophageal dysmotility, but it usually presents with reflux symptoms before dysphagia. Therefore, the correct answer is a. achalasia.",a,a,TRUE,
"8. man undergoes a pneumonectomy. after surgery, invs show hyponatremia. what could be the cause of the biochemical change?",a. removal of hormonally active tumor,b. excess dextrose,c. excess colloid,d. excessive k+,e. hemodilution,,,,,,key: the key is a. removal of harmonically active tumour. [ectopic acth secreting tumour causes hypernatremia and body's homeostatic mechanism try to lower the level of high sodium and do a lesser degree though sodium remains in hypernatremic level or even it may be normal (this question does not mention any preoperative hypernatremia). removal of that tumour results in negative sodium balance for time being which results hyponatremia while gradually it tends to rise again to normal level].,"One possible explanation for the hyponatremia observed in the man who underwent a pneumonectomy could be the removal of a hormonally active tumor. If the man had an ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor, it could have caused hypernatremia prior to surgery. The body's homeostatic mechanisms would have tried to lower the high sodium levels, but to a lesser extent, resulting in either normal or hypernatremic levels. However, removing the tumor would result in a negative sodium balance, leading to hyponatremia. Over time, sodium levels would tend to rise back to normal levels. Excess dextrose, colloid, excessive K+, and hemodilution are unlikely to be the cause of the hyponatremia.",a,a,TRUE,
9. pregnant lady came with pain in her calf muscle with local rise in temp to the antenatal clinic. what tx should be started?,a. aspirin,b. lmwh,c. paracetamol,d. cocodamol,e. aspirin and heparin,,,,,,"key: the key is b. lmwh. [injections with low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) are usually used to treat pregnant women with dvt. lmwh is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents the blood clot getting bigger. it does not affect the developing baby ( ref: nhs.uk)].","The correct answer is b. LMWH. Injections with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are usually used to treat pregnant women with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body, most commonly in the leg. This can cause pain, swelling, and warmth in the affected area. The use of LMWH is preferred in pregnant women as it is an anticoagulant that prevents the blood clot from getting bigger without affecting the developing baby. Aspirin is not recommended in pregnant women as it can affect the baby's growth and development. Paracetamol and cocodamol are painkillers and do not address the underlying issue of DVT. Aspirin and heparin together increase the risk of bleeding and are not advised. Hence, LMWH is the appropriate treatment option for a pregnant woman with symptoms of DVT.",b,b,TRUE,
"10. a 53yo female presents with an acute painful hot knee joint. she is a known case of ra. on examination, the knee is red, tender and swollen. the hamstring muscles are in spasm. her temp is 38.5c and bp is 120/80mmhg. what is the single best next inv?",a. joint aspiration for cytology and culture and sensitivity,b. joint aspiration for positive birefrengent crystals,c. joint aspiration for negative birefrengent crystals,d. blood culture,e. serum uric acid,,,,,,key:  the likely key is a. joint aspiration for cytology and culture and sensitivity. [case of septic arthritis. any chronically arthritic joint is predisposed to infection. moreover chronic use of steroid in rh. arthritis is one of the important predisposing factor.  in this age group likely organism is staphylococcus. in younger age group neisseria gonorrhea is more common].,"The correct answer is option A, joint aspiration for cytology and culture and sensitivity. This is because the patient has an acute painful hot knee joint which is a clinical presentation of septic arthritis. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis which is a predisposing factor for infection. Joint aspiration for cytology and culture and sensitivity is required to identify the causative organism and determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy. Option B and C are incorrect because they are used to diagnose crystal-induced arthritis which is not the suspected cause of the patient's presentation. Option D is incorrect because it is not specific for identifying the causative organism in the joint. Option E is incorrect because serum uric acid is not useful in this case as the patient does not present with symptoms of gout.",a,a,TRUE,
11.n 80yo man presented with pain in his lower back and hip. he also complains of waking up in the night to go to the washroom and has urgency as well as dribbling. what is the most likely dx?,a. bph,b. prostatitis,c. uti,d. prostate carcinoma,e. bladder carcinoma,,,,,,"key: the key is d. prostate carcinoma. [age, nocturia, urgency and dribbling points towards prostate pathology. pain of lower back and hip points towards bony metastases from prostate cancer. blood test for psa; prostate biopsy; mri (if initial biopsy is negative, to decide repeat biopsy). treatment options: 1. active treatment [i) radical prostatectomy ii) radical radiotherapy iii) hormone therapy iv) brachytherapy v) pelvic radiotherapy vi) orchidectomy 2. active surveillance 3. watchful waiting 4. palliative care (source: nice)].","The correct answer is d. prostate carcinoma. The patient's symptoms of nocturia, urgency, and dribbling, along with pain in his lower back and hip, suggest prostate pathology. The presence of bone pain also raises suspicion of bony metastases from prostate cancer. A blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and a prostate biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If the initial biopsy is negative, an MRI can help decide if a repeat biopsy is necessary. Treatment options include active treatment (radical prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy, hormone therapy, brachytherapy, pelvic radiotherapy, and orchidectomy), active surveillance, watchful waiting, and palliative care. BPH, prostatitis, UTI, and bladder carcinoma are less likely diagnoses given the patient's symptoms and age.",d,d,TRUE,
"12. an 18yo female has peri-orbital blisters. some of them are crusted, others secreting pinkish fluid. what is the most likely dx?",a. shingles,b. chicken pox,c. varicella,d. rubella,e. measles,,,,,,key: the key is a. shingles. [here ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve is involved. typically shingles are unilateral].,"The most likely diagnosis for an 18-year-old female with peri-orbital blisters that are crusted and secreting pinkish fluid is shingles. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. However, chickenpox typically occurs in younger children and typically presents with more generalized rash rather than localized blisters. Rubella and measles are caused by different viruses and have different presentations than shingles. It is important to note that shingles typically involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and is usually unilateral. Therefore, based on the presented symptoms, shingles seems to be the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
13. a 29yo lady who is a bank manager is referred by the gp to the medical opc due to a long hx of tiredness and pain in the joints. an autoimmune screen result showed smooth muscle antibodies positive. what is the most appropriate next inv?,a. ecg,b. tft,c. lft,d. serum glucose,e. jejunal biopsy,,,,,,key: the key is c. lft. [a case of autoimmune hepatitis. autoimmune hepatitis is an uncommon cause of chronic hepatitis which if untreated can lead to cirrhosis. however with treatment outlook is very good. smooth muscle antibody is positive in autoimmune hepatitis. definitive investigation is liver biopsy. treated with steroid [start with high dose prednisolone]. azathioprine is commonly added with steroid to reduce its dose as steroid has more side effects than azathioprine].,"The most appropriate next investigation for a 29-year-old lady with positive smooth muscle antibodies and a long history of tiredness and joint pain is option C - LFT. Smooth muscle antibody positive results can indicate autoimmune hepatitis, which is an uncommon cause of chronic hepatitis that can lead to cirrhosis if left untreated. Therefore, LFT is needed to check for liver inflammation, which is essential to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis. In contrast, ECG (A) is used to monitor heart activity, TSH (B) is used to evaluate thyroid function, serum glucose (D) is used to screen for diabetes, and jejunal biopsy (E) is used in cases of malabsorption syndrome. None of these investigations are necessary at this point considering her symptoms and positivity for smooth muscle antibodies. In conclusion, LFT is the appropriate investigation to perform in this case.",c,c,TRUE,
"14. a 5yo with recurrent chest pain, finger clubbing with offensive stool. choose the single most likely inv?",a. endomyseal/alpha glidin antibody,b. sweat test,c. barium meal,d. ecg,e. glucose tolerance test,,,,,,"key: the key is b. sweat test. [recurrent chest pain from frequent lung infections including pneumonia or bronchitis.""clubbing"" of the fingers is a classic features of cystic fibrosis, although not present in many patients.  the digestive enzymes are not being produced, food is not adequately digested (malabsorption) and excess fat and protein is lost in the stools, making them bulky, oily, smelly and difficult to flush away].","The most likely investigation for a 5-year-old with recurrent chest pain, finger clubbing, and offensive stool is a sweat test, making option B the correct answer. The symptoms described are classic features of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. The sweat test is used to measure the amount of salt in a person's sweat, as people with cystic fibrosis produce a higher than normal amount of salt in their sweat. Endomyseal/alpha glidin antibody, barium meal, ECG, and glucose tolerance tests are irrelevant and not useful in diagnosing cystic fibrosis. Therefore, the sweat test is the single most likely investigation to diagnose cystic fibrosis in a patient presenting with these specific symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
15. a clinical picture of breast cancer originated from the mammary duct. biopsy was done and there were neoplastic cells found. choose the histological picture of the cancer.,a. neoplastic cells are arranged in small clusters occupying a space between collagen bundles (seirrhous carcinoma),"b. spindle cell neoplasms with margins, which infiltrate adjacent structure, fat invaded (breast sarcoma)",c. small cells with round nucleus and scant indistinct cytoplasm (lobular carcinoma),,,,,,,,key: the key is c. small cells with round nucleus and scant indistinct cytoplasm (lobular carcinoma),"The correct answer is c, small cells with round nucleus and scant indistinct cytoplasm, which is the histological picture of lobular carcinoma. This type of breast cancer originates from the milk-producing glands and is composed of tumor cells that grow in a single-file pattern within the affected tissue. The neoplastic cells in this type of cancer have a characteristic appearance of small, round nuclei and a lack of distinct cytoplasm. Answer a, seirrhous carcinoma, is characterized by neoplastic cells arranged in small clusters occupying the space between collagen bundles and is commonly found in invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Answer b, spindle cell neoplasms with infiltrating margins and fat invasion, is seen in breast sarcoma, a rare type of breast cancer that begins in the connective tissue of the breast. Therefore, the answer is c, lobular carcinoma, due to its characteristic histological appearance and origin in the milk-producing glands of the breast.",c,c,TRUE,
16. a 22yo man has a reduced conscious level and a fixed dilated pupil after being involved in a mvc. choose the single most appropriate option?,a. facial nerve,b. oculomotor nerve,c. olfactory nerve,d. optic nerve,e. trigeminal nerve,,,,,,key: the key is b. oculomotor nerve. [3rd nerve damage can cause fixed dilated pupil].,"The correct answer is b. oculomotor nerve because damage to the 3rd cranial nerve can cause a fixed dilated pupil. The other choices are incorrect because the facial nerve (a) does not have a direct role in eye dilation, the olfactory nerve (c) is responsible for smell and not vision, the optic nerve (d) is responsible for transmitting visual information, but not pupil dilation, and the trigeminal nerve (e) controls sensation in the face, but not pupil dilation. Therefore, the most appropriate option in this scenario is the oculomotor nerve.",b,b,TRUE,
17. a man with suspected active tb wants to be treated at home. what should be done to prevent the spread of disease?,a. immediate start of the tx with anti-tb drugs,b. all family members should be immediately vaccinated with bcg vaccine,c. patient should be isolated in a negative pressure chamber in his house,d. universal prevention application protocol,,,,,,,key: the key is d. universal prevention application protocol.,"The correct answer is A, immediate start of the treatment with anti-tb drugs. Treatment of active TB should always be initiated as soon as possible in order to prevent the spread of the disease. This is because TB is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and immediate treatment will reduce the number of bacteria that can be spread to others. Option B, all family members should be immediately vaccinated with BCG vaccine, is incorrect because the BCG vaccine may not provide complete protection against TB, and it is not recommended for all individuals. Option C, patient should be isolated in a negative pressure chamber in his house, is also incorrect as not all families have access to a negative pressure chamber and it is not practical for most people to be isolated in such a chamber for a prolonged period of time. Option D, universal prevention application protocol, is too vague and does not provide a clear answer to the question.",d,a,corrected,
"18. a 7yo child is brought to the ed with a 1 day hx of being listless. on examination, the child is drowsy with an extensive non-blanching rash. what advice would you give the parents?",a. all family members need antibiotic therapy,b. only the mother should be given rifampicin prophylaxis,c. all family members need isolation,d. all family members should be given rifampicin prophylaxis,,,,,,,key: the key is d. all family members should be given rifampicin prophylaxis. [meningococcal disease. diagnosis is done with blood or csf pcr. initial prehospital management: benzyl penicillin or cefotaxime].,"The correct answer is D, which states that all family members should be given rifampicin prophylaxis. This is because the child is exhibiting symptoms of meningococcal disease, which is a serious bacterial infection that can be transmitted through close contact with an infected person. Rifampicin can help prevent the spread of the infection to other family members who may be carriers of the bacteria. Choices A and B are incorrect as antibiotics should only be given to those who are diagnosed with the infection, and isolation is not necessary unless the individual is diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. It is important for the child to be immediately transported to the hospital for further treatment.",d,d,TRUE,
"19. a 47yo man has a temp of 39c and is delirious. he has developed blisters mainly on his trunk, which appeared a few hours ago. he is well and not on any medications. he last travelled 5 months ago to italy. which of the following is the most likely dx?",a. shingles,b. chicken pox,c. pemphigoid,d. bullous pemphigus,,,,,,,"key: the key is b. chicken pox. [centripetal distribution of blisters favours chickenpox. adults more commonly develop a more generalized brain inflammation (""encephalitis"") whose symptoms may include delirium and seizures. incubation period of chicken-pox is 10-21 days. so this travel history is not significant].","Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is b. chicken pox. The patient's presentation of blisters mainly on his trunk that appeared a few hours ago aligns with the centripetal distribution of blisters commonly seen in chicken pox. Additionally, the patient's age of 47 is not typical for a shingles outbreak, which is more common in individuals over 50. Moreover, pemphigoid and bullous pemphigus are autoimmune disorders and would not present with a sudden onset of a fever and delirium. The patient's travel history to Italy is not significant, as the incubation period for chicken pox is between 10-21 days, which is well beyond the 5 months since his travel. Therefore, based on the information provided, chicken pox is the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
"20. a 64yo pt has been having freq episodes of secretory diarrhea, which is extremely watery, with large amounts of mucus. a dx of villous adenoma was made after endoscopy. what electrolyte abnormality is most likely in this pt?",a. hyperkalemia,b. hypernatremia,c. hyponatremia,d. hypokalemia,,,,,,,key: key not given. correct key is both c and d! [villous adenoma can cause both hyponatremia and hypokalemia].,"In a 64-year-old patient with frequent episodes of secretory diarrhea, which is extremely watery, with large amounts of mucus, a diagnosis of villous adenoma was made after endoscopy. The electrolyte abnormality most likely to be seen in this patient is hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Villous adenoma can cause both of these electrolyte imbalances due to the excessive secretion of electrolyte-rich fluids from the colonic mucosa into the lumen. Therefore, options a and b, which suggest hyperkalemia and hypernatremia, respectively, are incorrect. Option c, hyponatremia, and option d, hypokalemia, are both possible outcomes, and therefore the correct answer is c and d. The excess loss of sodium and potassium in the secretory diarrhea can lead to the development of these electrolyte imbalances and prompt management will be necessary to prevent complications.",c or d,c or d,TRUE,
21. a pt with an acute gout attack came to the ed. what drug should be given to relieve symptoms?,a. nsaids,b. allopurinol,c. ibuprofen,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. nsaids. [oral nsaids commenced immediately and continue for 1 – 2 weeks; colchicine can be effective alternative but is slower to work than nsaids. intra articular corticosteroids are highly effective in acute gouty monoarthritis.,"The correct answer is a) NSAIDs. NSAIDs should be commenced immediately and continued for 1-2 weeks to relieve the symptoms of an acute gout attack. Colchicine is another option but is slower to take effect than NSAIDs. Intra-articular corticosteroids are highly effective in acute gouty monoarthritis but are typically reserved for cases where other treatments have failed. Allopurinol is not indicated in the acute phase of gout and is instead used as a preventive measure to reduce the frequency of gout attacks in patients with recurrent gout. Ibuprofen is a type of NSAID and may be a reasonable choice, but the answer choices indicate it as a separate option, making it an incorrect choice. Therefore, NSAIDs are the most suitable choice for the immediate relief of symptoms in a patient with an acute gout attack.",a,a,TRUE,
"22. a pt was lying down on the operating table in a position with his arms hanging down for 3 hours. soon after he woke up, he complains of numbness and weakness in that hand and has limited wrist movement/wrist drop and sensory loss over dorsum of that hand, weakness of extension of the fingers and loss of sensation at the web of the thumb. what structure is likely to be damaged?",a. radial nerve,b. median nerve,c. ulnar nerve,d. axillary nerve,e. suprascapular nerve,,,,,,key: the key is a. radial nerve. [here arm hanging down compressing the radial nerve at the spiral groove is the cause of given scenario].,"The likely source of the damage is the radial nerve. The position in which the patient was lying with their arms hanging down for an extended period of time compressed the radial nerve at the spiral groove, causing the symptoms of numbness, weakness, and limited movement in the affected hand. Additionally, the symptoms of wrist drop and sensory loss over the dorsum of the hand and weakness of extension of the fingers and loss of sensation at the web of the thumb are specific to injury of the radial nerve. The other nerves listed (median, ulnar, axillary, and suprascapular) are not typically affected by this position and would present with different symptoms if injured.",a,a,TRUE,
23. a pt who was previously on 120mg slow release oral morphine has had his dose increased to 200mg. he is still in significant pain. he complains of drowsiness and constipation. what is the next step in the management?,a. increase slow release morphine dose,b. fentanyl patch,c. replace morphine with oral hydromorphone,d. replace morphine with oxycodone,e. subcutaneous morphine,,,,,,key: the key is d. replace morphine with oxycodone.,"The correct answer to this question is d. Replace morphine with oxycodone. Increasing the slow release morphine dose (a) may only exacerbate the patient's current side effects. Fentanyl patch (b) is not appropriate for this situation since the patient already has opioid-induced side effects. Oral hydromorphone (c) has a different potency than morphine, making it difficult to control the patient's pain and may also cause additional side effects. Subcutaneous morphine (e) is typically reserved for end-of-life care and not appropriate for this patient's current situation. Therefore, replacing morphine with oxycodone is the optimal next step as it provides a different mechanism of action and can help alleviate the patient's current side effects.",d,d,TRUE,
"24. a 40yo woman notices increasing lower abdominal distention with little/no pain. on examination, a lobulated cystic mass is felt and it seems to be arising from the pelvis. what is the most appropriate inv?",a. ca 125,b. ca 153,c. ca 199,d. cea,e. afp,,,,,,key: the key is a. ca 125. [ovarian ca is the likely diagnosis for which tumour marker is ca 125].,"The correct answer to the question is a. Ca 125. This is because ca 125 is a tumor marker that is commonly associated with epithelial ovarian cancer, which is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Ca 153 and ca 199 are also tumor markers, but they are not associated with ovarian cancer. CEA and AFP are tumor markers for colon cancer and germ line tumors respectively, which are not relevant to this case. In summary, the most appropriate investigation for a 40-year-old woman with a lobulated cystic mass arising from the pelvis and increasing lower abdominal distention is ca 125, as this is the most sensitive and specific tumor marker for ovarian cancer.",a,a,TRUE,
"25. a resident of a nursing home presented with rashes in his finger webs and also on his abdomen, with complaints of itching which is severe at night. he was dx with scabies. what the best tx for his condition?",a. 0.5% permethrin,b. doxycycline,c. 5% permethrin,d. reassure,e. acyclovir,,,,,,key: the key is c. 5% permethrin. [scabies outbreaks in nursing homes and cases of crusted scabies may require combination therapy consisting of topical application of permethrin and 2 oral doses of ivermectin at 200 mcg/kg (administered 1 wk apart)].,"The best treatment for scabies in a nursing home resident with rashes in finger webs and abdomen associated with severe itching at night is c. 5% permethrin. Permethrin is a topical insecticide that kills scabies mites and their eggs. Doxycycline is not effective against scabies as it is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. Reassurance and acyclovir are also not recommended for scabies treatment. Therefore, the correct answer is c. 5% permethrin as it is a first-line treatment for scabies and has been proven effective in managing scabies outbreaks, especially in nursing homes. It is worth noting that in cases of crusted scabies, combination therapy consisting of topical permethrin and oral doses of ivermectin may be necessary.",c,c,TRUE,
26. a 34yo alcoholic is found passed out in front of a local pub. the ambulance crew informs you that he was sweating when they found him and there were cans of cider lying empty around him. what is the initial stage of inv?,a. capillary blood sugar,b. ct head,c. mri head,d. abg,e. mcv,,,,,,key: the key is a. capillary blood sugar. [alcohol induced hypoglycemia can present as this case].,"The correct answer is a. Capillary blood sugar. This is because alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is a possible presentation in this case. Sweating and empty cans of cider suggest that the individual may be experiencing an alcohol-induced hypoglycemic episode, where their blood sugar levels become dangerously low due to alcohol intake. Checking their capillary blood sugar is crucial as it provides an indicator of their blood sugar levels at that moment and helps determine the appropriate course of action. The other choices are not relevant in this case because a CT or MRI of the head or an arterial blood gas analysis are not necessary for diagnosing hypoglycemia. Similarly, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measure of the size of red blood cells and is not useful in diagnosing an alcohol-induced hypoglycemic episode.",a,a,TRUE,
27. a young boy fell on his outstretched hand and has presented with pain around the elbow. he has absent radial pulse on the affected hand. what is the most likely dx?,a. dislocated elbow,b. angulated supracondylar fx,c. undisplaced fx of radial head,d. posterior dislocation of shoulder,,,,,,,key: the key is b. angulated supracondyllar fx. [damage or occlusion of the bracheal artery is the cause of absent radial pulse. often closed reduction results in restoration of normal anatomy and correction of occlusion of bracheal artery and establishes circulation again but in few instances open reduction is required to fix the occluded artery].,"The most likely diagnosis for a young boy who fell on his outstretched hand and presents with pain around the elbow and absent radial pulse on the affected hand is angulated supracondylar fracture. The absence of a radial pulse suggests an interruption of blood flow in the brachial artery, which can occur due to the fracture fragment causing a physical obstruction or due to stretching of the artery at the time of injury. It is important to note that closed reduction can usually restore normal anatomy and re-establish circulation, but in rare instances, open reduction may be required to fix the occluded artery. Dislocated elbow, undisplaced fracture of radial head or posterior dislocation of shoulder are less likely diagnoses in this scenario and are not associated with absent radial pulse.",b,b,TRUE,
28. a 65yo woman presented with transient arm and leg weakness as well as a sudden loss of vision in the left eye. her symptoms resolved within the next couple of hours. what is the most appropriate next inv?,a. ct brain,b. echo,c. doppler usg,d. arteriography,e. 24h ecg,,,,,,key: the key is c. [a case of tia. probable cause carotid artery atherosclerosis].,"Based on the patient's clinical presentation of transient arm and leg weakness and sudden loss of vision in the left eye, the most appropriate next investigation would be a Doppler ultrasound (choice C) to check for carotid artery stenosis or atherosclerosis. This is supported by the given key which states that the probable cause of the patient's condition is carotid artery atherosclerosis. A CT brain (choice A) would not provide any information regarding the underlying cause of the symptoms, while an echocardiogram (choice B) would be useful if a cardiac source of embolism was suspected, which is not the case here. Arteriography (choice D) is an invasive technique and is not typically the first-line investigation for this presentation. A 24-hour ECG (choice E) is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms. Therefore, choice C is the most appropriate investigation in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,

Compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, known as cubital tunnel syndrome, causes numbness in the 5th finger, along the half of the 4th finger closest to the 5th finger, and the back half of the hand over the 5th finger. This location of numbness indicates that the ulnar nerve is affected. The other nerve options, such as the median, radial, long thoracic, and axillary nerves, do not innervate the specific area where the man is experiencing numbness and therefore are not likely to be involved.",b,b,TRUE,
30. a young man complains of double vision on seeing to the right. which nerve is most likely to be involved?,a. left abducens,b. right abducens,c. left trochlear,d. right trochlear,e. right oculomotor,,,,,,key: the key is b. right abducens. [diplopia on seeing to right indicates right lateral rectus palsy which is supplied by right abducent nerve].,"The correct answer is b. right abducens. The young man's complaint of double vision on seeing to the right indicates a right lateral rectus palsy, which is supplied by the right abducent nerve. The other choices are incorrect because the left abducens supplies the left lateral rectus and would not cause diplopia on seeing to the right. The left trochlear supplies the superior oblique muscle and its palsy would lead to vertical diplopia. The right trochlear supplies the superior oblique muscle on the right side and its palsy would also cause vertical diplopia. The right oculomotor nerve supplies multiple muscles including the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles, and its palsy would typically produce a different pattern of eye movement abnormalities.",b,b,TRUE,

[here patients thoughts are obsession and though no compulsive act is described (like repeated cleansing of dirt) but his nature of thought like inability to resist the thinking or getting palpitation on trying to avoid thinking can be regarded as compulsion of thought. cbt 1st line. ssris].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 45-year-old man with intrusive thoughts about dirt under the bed is b. OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). Although he does not exhibit any compulsive behavior like repeated cleansing, the compulsive nature of his thoughts, such as his inability to resist thinking or getting palpitations when trying to avoid thinking, can be considered as a compulsion of thought. The first-line treatment for OCD is CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors). The other choices, including a. OC personality, c. schizophrenia, d. panic disorder, and e. phobia, do not fit the presented symptoms and overall clinical picture.",b,b,TRUE,
32. a 33yo man presents with an itchy scaly annular rash on his thigh after a walk in the park. which of the following drugs will treat his condition?,a. erythromycin,b. doxycycline,c. penicillin,d. amoxicillin,,,,,,,key: the key is b. doxycycline.

The correct answer to this question is option B, doxycycline, as it is the first-line antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Erythromycin is not an effective treatment for Lyme disease, while penicillin and amoxicillin can be used for early-stage Lyme disease but not for late-stage Lyme disease. Therefore, doxycycline is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition due to its effectiveness against the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and its ease of administration.",b,b,TRUE,
33. a pt with cerebral mets has polyuria and polydipsia. what part of the brain would be affected?,a. cerebral cortex,b. cerebellum,c. diencephalon,d. pons,e. medulla,,,,,,"key: the key is c. diencephalon. [diencephalon is the caudal (posterior) part of the forebrain, containing the epithalamus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and ventral thalamus and the third ventricle. hypothalamus produce adh and hens lesion of diencephalon (hypothalsamus) may produce  cranial diabetes insipidus.","The correct answer is c. diencephalon. The diencephalon is the posterior part of the forebrain which includes the hypothalamus responsible for regulating water balance and producing ADH. Lesions in the hypothalamus may cause cranial diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia. The cerebral cortex (a), cerebellum (b), pons (d), and medulla (e) are not directly involved in regulating water balance. Therefore, the diencephalon is the most relevant part of the brain affected in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,
34. a 32yo man presented with painless hematuria. he is hypertensive but the rest of the exam is unremarkable. what is the most likely dx?,a. polycystic kidneys,b. ca bladder,c. ca prostate,d. ttp,e. hus,,,,,,key: the key is a. polycystic kidneys. [painless haematuria at an younger age with hypertension is suggestive of polycystic kidney disease. renal ultrasound is used to diagnose the condition].,"Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for the 32-year-old man with painless hematuria and hypertension is polycystic kidneys (Answer A). This is because painless hematuria at a younger age along with hypertension is suggestive of polycystic kidney disease. A renal ultrasound is used to diagnose the condition. Options B, C, D, and E are unlikely as they are not associated with the classic presentation of this patient. A bladder cancer or prostate cancer may cause hematuria, but they are typically painful and are associated with other symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, and difficulties in urination. TTP and HUS are associated with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is not present in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this man's symptoms is polycystic kidneys.",a,a,TRUE,
35. a 45yo female complains of pain in the inner side of her right thigh. she was dx with benign ovarian mass on the right. which nerve is responsible for this pain?,a. femoral nerve,b. obturator nerve,c. iliohypogastric nerve,d. ovarian branch of splanchic nerve,e. pudendal nerve,,,,,,key: the key is b. obturator nerve. [the obturator nerve is responsible for the sensory innervation of the skin of the medial aspect of the thigh].,"The correct answer for this question is b. Obturator nerve. This nerve is responsible for providing sensory innervation to the skin of the medial aspect of the thigh, which includes the inner side of the right thigh. The femoral nerve, iliohypogastric nerve, ovarian branch of splanchic nerve, and pudendal nerve do not provide sensory innervation to this area and are therefore incorrect options. It is important to understand the functions of different nerves in order to accurately diagnose and treat conditions. In this case, knowledge of the obturator nerve's sensory innervation helped narrow down the options and identify the correct nerve responsible for the patient's pain.",b,b,TRUE,

Erotomania is a type of delusional disorder characterized by a false belief that someone, usually of higher status, is in love with the affected person. In this case, the lady has a false belief that a famous politician is in love with her and sends her flowers every day. This delusion is not based on any actual evidence and is not reciprocated by the politician. Pyromania, kleptomania, and trichotillomania are impulse control disorders characterized by repetitive, uncontrollable behaviors such as starting fires, stealing items, and pulling out one's hair, respectively. Grandiosity refers to an unrealistic sense of superiority, which is not applicable in this case. Therefore, A is the correct answer to this question.",a,a,TRUE,

A facial X-ray should be done to exclude any facial bone fracture. Since the child has a normal GCS, it makes an intracranial lesion less likely, making option ""a. skull X-ray"" unnecessary. CT scan and MRI are not the first-line investigations for facial lacerations, making options ""c. CT scan"" and ""d. MRI"" incorrect choices. Lastly, observation alone is not sufficient as fractures may be missed, making option ""e. observation"" an incorrect choice as well. Therefore, a facial X-ray is the most appropriate next investigation in this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,

[dx is cll. age of patient (usually above 50 yrs), lymhadenopathy and splenomegaly, appearance of lymphocytes (mature lymphocytes – but functionally not normal). repeated chest infection points towards abnormal function of lymphocytes against infection].","Based on the patient's age, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and recent chest infections, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and the single most likely blood film finding is an excess of mature lymphocytes. CLL is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many lymphocytes, and typically affects those over 50 years of age. The presence of mature lymphocytes in excess is a hallmark sign of CLL, as these cells accumulate to abnormally high levels in the blood. In contrast, atypical lymphocytes and blast cells are usually indicative of other types of leukemia, or viral infections. Plasma cells suggest multiple myeloma, and multiple immature granulocytes with blast cells suggest acute myeloid leukemia. Therefore, the correct answer is B, excess of mature lymphocytes, as it aligns with the patient's clinical presentation and suspected diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

[duct ectasia of the breast or mammary duct ectasia or plasma cell mastitis is a condition in which the lactiferous duct becomes blocked or clogged. this is the most common cause of greenish discharge. mammary duct ectasia can mimic breast cancer. it is a disorder of peri- or post-menopausal age].,"The most likely diagnosis for this lady's symptoms of itching around the breast and greenish, foul-smelling discharge from the nipple is duct ectasia (option b). This is a condition in which the lactiferous duct becomes blocked or clogged and is the most common cause of greenish discharge. Duct papilloma (option a) usually presents with bloody discharge and breast abscess (option c) would present with localized pain and redness, not itching. Periductal mastitis (option d) is characterized by a painful lump beneath the areola and would not typically cause itching or greenish discharge. Mammary duct fistula (option e) may cause a discharge but would not present with itching. Therefore, option b is the best answer based on this patient's presenting symptoms. However, it is important to note that mammary duct ectasia can mimic breast cancer, so further evaluation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

[only bilirubin is increased but not the liver enzymes. also positive nicotinic acid provocation test is in its favour].,"Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this young male with yellow sclera is c. Gilbert's Syndrome. This is because the test showed raised bilirubin levels, but normal liver enzymes (ALT and AST), which is characteristic of Gilbert's Syndrome. Additionally, the positive Nicotinic Acid provocation test further supports this diagnosis, as this is a diagnostic tool used to confirm Gilbert's Syndrome by causing a rise in bilirubin levels. Acute hepatitis B and acute pancreatitis would both show abnormal liver enzymes, making them less likely diagnoses. Drug hypersensitivity may show raised bilirubin levels but would not necessarily be associated with yellowing of the sclera. Therefore, based on the information provided, Gilbert's Syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,

[it is a case of rhabdomyolysis which is initially treated with iv ns].,"The correct answer is B, IV NS. This patient is experiencing rhabdomyolysis, which is caused by muscle breakdown and leads to the release of myoglobin into the blood. Myoglobin can damage the kidneys and cause acute kidney injury, which is why hydration with IV NS is the most important step in management. The IV NS will help flush out the myoglobin and prevent further kidney damage. Dialysis may be necessary if the patient develops severe kidney failure, but it is not the first step. IV dextrose and KCl are not indicated in this case. Pain relief may be necessary, but it is not the most important step in management.",b,b,TRUE,

This causes the kidneys to retain water, resulting in high urine osmolarity. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because they suggest high serum sodium, high serum osmolarity, or low urine osmolarity, which are not consistent with SIADH. High serum sodium and osmolarity would indicate dehydration, while low urine osmolarity would suggest impaired kidney function. Therefore, option B is the best answer based on the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of SIADH.",b,b,TRUE,

[chest is clear, so there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. muffled heart sound is due to fluid in pericardial space, low bp from reduced chamber expansion due to pericardial fluid’s pressure and restricted right heart expansion causes raised jvp].","In this scenario, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade, indicated by the presence of muffled heart sounds, low blood pressure, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and clear lungs ruling out pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, preventing normal heart function and reducing chamber expansion. This leads to low blood pressure and increased JVP due to restricted right heart expansion. Pulmonary embolism and hemothorax would present with respiratory symptoms, while pericardial effusion may not lead to such severe hemodynamic compromise. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade.",b,b,TRUE,

[after  mi elective surgery should not be done before 6 months post mi, as operation in earlier than this time has significant increase in mortality].","The correct answer is B, MI 2 months ago. Elective surgery should not be performed before 6 months following a myocardial infarction, as operations done earlier than this time have a significant increase in mortality. Choice A, SBP 110mmHg, does not necessitate a postponement of the operation, as the blood pressure is within the normal range. Choice C, Hgb 12g/dL, is within the normal limits for hemoglobin, and thus does not warrant a postponement. Choice D, pain around hernia, may require further evaluation but does not necessarily mean that a postponement of the operation is needed. Choice E, abdominal distention, is not a contraindication for undergoing herniorraphy.",b,b,TRUE,

HELLP syndrome. This is a life-threatening liver disorder that occurs during pregnancy and is considered a severe form of preeclampsia. It is characterized by hemolysis or the destruction of red blood cells, elevated liver enzymes that indicate liver damage, and low platelet count. In this case, the patient's symptoms and blood results, such as the mild anemia, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and hemolysis, are all consistent with the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome. The other answer choices (acute fatty liver of pregnancy, acute pyelonephritis, cholecystitis, and acute hepatitis) do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, making them less likely diagnoses.

46. a woman comes with an ulcerated lesion 3 cm in the labia majorum. what is the lymphatic drainage of this area?,a. external iliac,b. superficial inguinal ln,c. para-aortic,d. iliac,e. aortic,,,,,,key: key is b. superficial inguinal ln.,"The correct answer is b. superficial inguinal lymph node. The lymphatic drainage of the labia majorum is primarily to the superficial inguinal lymph node. This node receives drainage from the lower limb, perineum, and external genitalia. Therefore, the location of the lesion makes superficial inguinal lymph node the most likely drainage route. The other options are incorrect as they do not drain the area of interest. The external iliac lymph nodes are located higher up in the abdomen and drain the pelvic organs. The para-aortic lymph nodes are located behind the abdominal cavity and drain the retroperitoneum. The iliac lymph nodes are located in the pelvis and drain the pelvic organs and lower extremities. The aortic lymph nodes are located next to the aorta and drain the abdominal organs. Therefore, superficial inguinal lymph node is the correct answer due to its close proximity to the area of interest and its drainage pattern.",b,b,TRUE,

Elderly patients are at a higher risk of developing subdural hematomas even with minor head injuries, and it can present with progressive confusion, drowsiness, and unsteadiness. The patient's history of taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of bleeding. The other options are less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Extradural hemorrhage (option A) is uncommon in the elderly, and cerebellar hemorrhage (option B) usually presents with severe symptoms. Epidural hemorrhage (option C) typically presents with acute onset symptoms and is associated with a skull fracture, which is not present in this case. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (option E) usually presents with a sudden onset of severe headache and other neurological symptoms, which are not present in this case.

Herpes zoster is a viral infection caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. It commonly presents with a painful rash with fluid-filled blisters in a single dermatome, which in this case, is the left ear. Acne, insect bites, and cellulitis do not typically present with vesicles and should not be considered as probable diagnoses. Chickenpox usually occurs in childhood, and it is less likely for the lady to develop it at 22 years of age. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's symptoms is herpes zoster.

Congenital cholesteatomas, on the other hand, have a mass medial to the tympanic membrane and a normal tympanic membrane, and no previous history of ear discharge, perforation or ear surgery. Acute OM may cause similar symptoms, however, the presence of foul smelling discharge and perforation is more indicative of cholesteatoma. OM with effusion could be a possible diagnosis, but foul smelling discharge and perforation are not typical of this condition. Otitis externa is unlikely as the symptoms suggest middle ear involvement. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is acquired cholesteatoma.",c,c,TRUE,
52. a female with t1dm would like to know about a deficiency of vitamins in pregnancy that can be harmful. a deficiency of which vitamin can lead to teratogenic effects in the child?,a. folic acid,b. vit b12,c. thiamine,d. riboflavine.,e. pyridoxine,,,,,,key: the key is a. folic acid. [frequently associated with neural tube defect].,"One important deficiency of vitamins that can lead to teratogenic effects in a child during pregnancy is a lack of folic acid. Folic acid is frequently associated with neural tube defects, which are malformations of the spinal cord and brain. These defects can cause serious health problems for the child, including paralysis, intellectual disability, and even death. While vitamins B12, thiamine, riboflavin, and pyridoxine are all important for overall health and wellbeing, they are not specifically linked to teratogenic effects during pregnancy. Therefore, it is particularly important for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, especially those with t1dm, to ensure that they consume enough folic acid to promote healthy fetal development.",a,a,TRUE,

This can be diagnosed through Finkelstein's test, which involves ulnar deviation of the hand causing pain along the distal radius. Avascular necrosis of the scaphoid and trigger finger are less likely causes as they do not typically present with pain at the base of the thumb in the context of these activities.",c,c,TRUE,

[management: 1. oxygen inhalation 2. nasogastric feeding. don’t use: i) bronchodilator ii) steroid iii) antibiotics routinely. [ohcs, 9th edition, page-160]","Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for the 6-month-old child presenting with fever and cough is a. bronchiolitis. This is because bronchiolitis is a common viral respiratory infection that occurs in infants and young children, and is characterized by fever, cough, and difficulty feeding. The management for bronchiolitis includes administering oxygen inhalation and nasogastric feeding, but not bronchodilators, steroids or antibiotics routinely as these are not effective against viral infections. Therefore, options b and c are incorrect because they suggest using treatments that are not appropriate for the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. In summary, the given information suggests that the most likely diagnosis for the 6-month-old child is a. bronchiolitis and the correct management plan includes oxygen inhalation and nasogastric feeding while avoiding bronchodilators, steroids, or antibiotics routinely.",a,a,TRUE,

[2 maind/d. aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. aortic stenosis – more likely in elderly.  and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – less likely in this age].,"The correct answer is b. Echo. This diagnostic tool will aid in identifying the underlying medical condition of the patient. The patient has a systolic murmur on examination which is indicative of a heart problem. Based on the patient's age, aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are two probable causes. The use of an ECG would provide some information about the patient's heart function, but it is not definitive. 24-hour ECG and BP monitoring would be more useful in cases of arrhythmias or hypertension. The most appropriate and effective diagnostic test in this case would be an Echo, which will provide a clearer picture of the heart's structure and function to help identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal side effect of antipsychotic medication, and typically presents soon after initiation or an increase in dosage of the medication. The syndrome is characterized by rigidity, fever, elevated creatinine kinase, and autonomic instability, including tachycardia. It is not commonly associated with renal failure, which is a symptom of other conditions such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. Pyrexia, elevated creatinine kinase, and tachycardia are all typical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.",d,d,TRUE,

Methadone is a medication used to treat opioid addiction by reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings. It is typically given as part of a medication-assisted treatment program under medical supervision. Benzodiazepines and diazepoxide are not appropriate choices for this patient as they are primarily used for anxiety and alcohol withdrawal, respectively. Lithium is used primarily for mood stabilization in conditions such as bipolar disorder. Disulfiram is used to treat alcohol dependence, but this patient's drug of abuse is an opiate, not alcohol. Methadone is the most appropriate choice for this patient's specific situation.",d,d,TRUE,

[as an expert to intubate]. key: 2. diagnosis is acute epiglottitis. key: 3. in given case urgent intubation is needed to secure airway to prevent closure of airway.,"The correct answer is c. Call anesthesiologist. The given symptoms suggest the presence of acute epiglottitis which can cause obstruction of the airway leading to respiratory distress. Thus, urgent intubation is required to secure the airway and prevent closure of the airway. Option a, direct pharyngoscopy, is not recommended as it can induce the child to further close the already narrowed airway. Option b, calling the ENT surgeon, is not a priority as urgent intubation is needed before any further surgical procedure. Option d, IV fluids, may be needed at a later stage for hydration but it is not the immediate management of airway obstruction. Option e, starting antibiotics, is important but it is not the first step in the management of airway obstruction. Therefore, calling an experienced anesthesiologist who can perform intubation in a safe and timely manner is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the patient has pyramidal weakness of the left lower limb, which is controlled by the corticospinal tracts that run through the spinal cord. The reduced pain and temperature sensation on the right leg and right side of the trunk up to the umbilicus indicates a lesion on the same side as the weakness, as this is characteristic of the Brown-Sequard syndrome.

[increased shortness of breath and chest pain with no past medical history favours the dx of pneumothorax. heavy smoking or tobacco is a risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax].,"Based on the presenting symptoms and risk factors, the likely diagnosis in this case is e. pneumothorax. The patient is a heavy smoker, which is a known risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax. Moreover, the patient is experiencing increasing shortness of breath and chest pain, which are common symptoms of a pneumothorax. The other answer choices are less likely because they do not fit the patient's specific symptoms and risk factors. Pulmonary embolism is typically associated with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain, whereas MI would present with more specific symptoms such as chest tightness or pressure. Asthma usually has a history of underlying respiratory issues or triggers, and pleural effusion is typically associated with coughing or difficulty breathing lying down. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is e. pneumothorax.",e,e,TRUE,

Hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a condition of primary iron overload that can cause hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with raised levels of serum ferritin. Ferritin levels higher than 200 mcg/L in premenopausal women and 300 mcg/L in men and postmenopausal women suggest hemochromatosis, especially when there is evidence of liver disease and high transferrin saturation. A ferritin concentration higher than 1000 mcg/L further indicates liver damage with fibrosis or cirrhosis. A1 antitrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis are not associated with elevated ferritin levels, and therefore, they are unlikely causes of the raised ferritin levels in the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.",a,a,TRUE,

[electric pains in her face that starts with the jaw and moves upwards [this description indicates neurological pain of trigeminal nerve. in trigeminal neuralgia transient loss of corneal reflexs are seen just after attacks but in between attacks corneal reflexes are quite normal].,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is b. trigeminal neuralgia. The electric pains in the face that start with the jaw and move upwards suggest neurological pain of the trigeminal nerve, which is a classic symptom of trigeminal neuralgia. Additionally, the fact that the patient's corneal reflexes are normal does not rule out trigeminal neuralgia as transient loss of corneal reflexes are seen just after attacks, while in between attacks, corneal reflexes are quite normal. The other choices are less likely diagnoses. Atypical face pain is a broad diagnosis that does not fit the specific symptoms described here. Tempero-mandibular joint dysfunction may cause pain in the jaw, but it is less likely to cause electric pains that move upwards. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) typically causes headaches, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication, but electric pains are not a typical symptom. Finally, herpes zoster would typically present with a rash and blisters, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is trigeminal neuralgia.",b,b,TRUE,

[progressive dysphagia to mostly solid is suggestive of peptic stricture which is supported here by the use of prokinetic drugs and h2 blockers which are used for reflux oesophagitis].,"Based on the presented information, the most likely diagnosis for the 32-year-old male is d. peptic stricture. The progressive dysphagia to mostly solid food is suggestive of peptic stricture, which is further supported by the patient's past history of retro-sternal discomfort and treatment with prokinetics and h2 blockers. Foreign body and pharyngeal pouch can cause dysphagia but are less likely given the patient's past history and medication treatment. Plummer Vinson syndrome is a rare condition that is more commonly seen in females over the age of 40, making it an unlikely diagnosis for this patient. Esophageal cancer is also a possibility, but given the patient's age and lack of other significant symptoms, it is less likely than a peptic stricture.

[carotid artery divides to internal and external carotid of which internal continues as middle cerebral ultimately. but just before it becomes middle cerebral internal carotid gives rise to ophthalmic branch. so middle cerebral occlusion may give partial visual loss but not complete mono-ocular blindness. for complete mono-ocular blindness occlusion should be proximal to ophthalmic artery i.e. either in internal carotid or more proximally to carotid artery]. key: 2. i)	middle cerebral artery occlusion: paralysis or weakness of contralateral face and arm (faciobracheal). sensory loss of the contralatera face and arm. ii)	anterior cerebral artery occlusion: paralysis or weakness of the contralateral foot and leg. sensory loss at the contralateral foot and leg.,"The occlusion in this case is most likely in the carotid artery. The carotid artery divides into the internal and external carotid arteries, with the internal carotid continuing on as the middle cerebral artery. However, just before it becomes the middle cerebral artery, the internal carotid gives rise to the ophthalmic branch. Therefore, a middle cerebral artery occlusion may result in partial visual loss but not complete mono-ocular blindness. For complete mono-ocular blindness, the occlusion should be proximal to the ophthalmic artery, in the internal carotid artery or more proximally in the carotid artery. The options of ant meningeal artery, mid meningeal artery, ant cerebral artery, and ant communicating artery are not likely to be the sites of occlusion since they do not supply the areas of the brain noted in the patient's symptoms. The middle cerebral artery supplies the face and arm, and an anterior cerebral artery occlusion would affect the contralateral foot and leg. Therefore, the most likely occlusion site in this patient is the carotid artery.",d,d,TRUE,

The combination of tachyarrhythmia, high fever, perforated nasal septum, and unconsciousness are highly suggestive of cocaine toxicity. Other findings typically associated with cocaine toxicity include psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and paranoia, tachypnoea, increased energy, and rapid speech, as well as dilated pupils. In addition, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, and convulsions may also be seen in cases of cocaine overdose. Marijuana, heroin, alcohol, and CO poisoning are not likely to produce the same symptoms, therefore making them incorrect answers.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the patient has already been taking oral morphine but is experiencing increased drowsiness and is unable to carry out daily activities when the dose is increased to manage worsening pain. Oral oxycodone may be a more effective option for pain relief without the added side effects of excess drowsiness. Oral tramadol may not provide sufficient pain relief for the patient's worsening pain, and PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) or IV fentanyl and diamorphine would be more invasive methods of pain management that may not be necessary at this stage.",a,a,TRUE,

This is based on the key characteristic that a branchial cyst presents as an anterior triangular lump, which matches the location and description of the man's mass. Parotitis can also present as an anterior triangular lump, but would regress with appropriate treatment whereas this mass has not. Pharyngeal pouch and thyroglossal cyst present as a posterior triangular lump and midline lump, respectively, which do not match the reported location of the mass. Thyroid swelling moves with swallowing, which has not been reported in the case. Therefore, the answer is A, branchial cyst, based on the location and presentation of the mass.",a,a,TRUE,

Naloxone. The patient is presenting with classic signs of opiate overdose, such as reduced consciousness, respiratory rate of 8/min which is below the normal range, hypotension (although still categorized as lower normal), miosis and needle track marks on his arms. The administration of naloxone will help reverse the effects of the opioids and restore adequate respiratory drive. It is important to note that insulin, methadone and gastric lavage are not appropriate initial treatments for opiate overdose. Insulin is used to treat hyperkalemia, methadone is used in the management of opioid addiction and gastric lavage is no longer recommended due to the risk of complications. Therefore, the single best initial treatment for this patient is the administration of naloxone.",b,b,TRUE,

The diagnosis is Klinefelter’s syndrome (key 2), supported by the presence of infertility, tall stature, bilateral gynecomastia, and bilateral small, firm testes (key 3). CT of the pituitary would not be the most helpful investigation since it is not consistent with the clinical features of Klinefelter’s syndrome. Measuring serum gonadotropins and testosterone would also not be the most helpful investigation since they are not specific to Klinefelter’s syndrome and can be normal in some cases.

Given the patient's symptoms, which include urinary dribbling and incontinence, it is likely that the patient is suffering from urinary retention. While alcoholism can cause urinary retention, it is a less common cause compared to other factors such as an enlarged prostate or bladder stones. A urethral catheter would be the most appropriate step in management to relieve the patient's symptoms of urinary retention. Options b, c, d, and e are not the best choices as a suprapubic catheter or nephrostomy tube may be more invasive and carry more risks, while antibiotics and condom catheter would not address the underlying issue of urinary retention.

The given key mentions that puffiness is due to lupus nephritis, which is a feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The appearance of white fluffy lesions within the retina called cotton wool spots is a classic manifestation of SLE involving the retina. Hence, the presence of cotton wool spots on fundoscopy and puffiness of the face in a patient suggests the diagnosis of SLE.

Abdominal ultrasound is the single most discriminating investigation as it can confirm the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which is the likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's hypertension, abdominal and back pain, and expansile abdominal mass lateral and superior to the umbilicus all point towards AAA. Laparoscopy is an invasive procedure that is not necessary for diagnosing AAA. KUB x-ray and rectal exam are not helpful in diagnosing AAA. Pelvic ultrasound is not specific for AAA and would not provide enough information to confirm this diagnosis. Therefore, the best option for confirming the presence of an AAA in this patient is an abdominal ultrasound.",e,e,TRUE,
77. a 55yo man has had severe pain in the right hypochondrium for 24h. the pain comes in waves and is accompanied by nausea. nothing seems to relieve the pain. he feels hot and sweaty but has normal temp. what is the most appropriate next inv?,a. us abdomen,b. ercp,c. mrcp,d. serum amylase,e. ugi endoscopy,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is a. us abdomen. key: 2. the diagnosis is biliary colic. key: 3. points in favour- i) severe right hypochondrial pain. ii) colicky nature of the pain (comes in waves) iii) nausea iv) absence of fever iv) absence of jaundice. [ohcm, 9th edition, page-637].","The correct answer for the most appropriate next investigation for a 55 year-old man with severe pain in the right hypochondrium for 24 hours accompanied by nausea and colicky nature of the pain is A, ultrasound (US) abdomen. The points in favor of the diagnosis being biliary colic include severe right hypochondrial pain, colicky nature of pain, nausea, absence of fever, and absence of jaundice. These symptoms are consistent with biliary colic, which is typically caused by gallstones blocking the bile duct. Therefore, US abdomen is the most appropriate next investigation to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the gallstones. The other options, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), serum amylase, and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy are less appropriate and not as specific for biliary colic. ERCP and MRCP are more invasive and not usually the initial tests of choice, serum amylase is not helpful in diagnosing biliary colic, and UGI endoscopy is more appropriate for upper gastrointestinal issues, but not for biliary colic. In summary, US abdomen is the most appropriate next investigation for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,
78. a 67yo man has deteriorating vision in his left eye. he has longstanding copd and is on multiple drug therapy. what single medication is likely to cause this visual deterioration?,a. b2 agonist,b. corticosteroid,c. diuretic,d. theophylline,,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. corticosteroid. key: 2. prolonged corticostiroids [also topical i.e. eye drop] can cause cataract.,"The correct answer is b. corticosteroids. Prolonged use of corticosteroids, including topical ones such as eye drops, can lead to the development of cataracts, which is likely the cause of the man's deteriorating vision in his left eye. B2 agonists, diuretics, and theophylline are not typically associated with the development of cataracts, so these medications are unlikely to be causing the man's vision problems. Therefore, the most likely culprit in this case is the man's prolonged use of corticosteroids.",b,b,TRUE,
79. a woman who returned from abroad after 3 weeks of holiday complains of severe diarrhea of 3 weeks. she also developed ida and folic acid def. what condition best describes her situation?,a. jejunal villous atrophy,b. chronic diarrhea secretions,c. malabsorption,d. increased catabolism,e. increased secretions of acid,,,,,,key: the key is c. malabsorption.,"Based on the given information, the condition that best describes the woman's situation is c. malabsorption. Malabsorption is a medical term used to describe conditions where the small intestine fails to absorb or properly digest nutrients from the food consumed, leading to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals. In this case, the woman's severe diarrhea for three weeks may have caused damage to the small intestine, leading to malabsorption, as evidenced by her iron-deficiency anemia and folate deficiency. Choice a is incorrect because jejunal villous atrophy, or damage of the small intestine lining, is a potential cause of malabsorption, but it is not the specific condition the woman is experiencing. Chronic diarrhea secretions (choice b) and increased secretions of acid (choice e) are also incorrect because they are not specific enough to explain the woman's symptoms and do not address the issues of anemia and nutrient deficiencies. Increased catabolism (choice d) refers to the breakdown of nutrients, rather than their inadequate absorption, so this choice is also incorrect.",c,c,TRUE,
80. a 35yo male is bitterly annoyed with people around him. he thinks that people are putting ideas into his head. what is the single most likely dx?,a. thought block,b. thought insertion,c. thought broadcasting,d. thought withdrawal,e. reference,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. thought insertion. key: 2. it is seen in schizophrenia.,"The correct answer is b. thought insertion, which is a symptom of schizophrenia. In thought insertion, a person believes that their thoughts are not their own and are being inserted into their mind by an external force. This can lead to feelings of paranoia and the belief that others are controlling them. The other answer options, thought block, thought broadcasting, thought withdrawal, and reference are not applicable to this scenario. Thought block refers to a sudden interruption or stopping of one's thoughts. Thought broadcasting is the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcasted to others. Thought withdrawal is the belief that one's thoughts are being taken away by an external force. Reference is a symptom in which one believes that certain events or objects have special meaning or significance to them.",b,b,TRUE,
81. a 10yo girl presents with hoarseness of the voice. she is a known case of bronchial asthma and has been on oral steroids for a while. what is the most likely cause of hoarseness?,a. laryngeal candidiasis,b. infective tonsillitis,c. laryngeal edema,d. allergic drug reaction,e. ludwigs angina,,,,,,key: 1. the key is a. laryngeal candidiasis. key: 2. steroids predisposes to fungal infection.,"The correct answer is a. Laryngeal candidiasis. Oral steroids can weaken the immune system, which can in turn predispose the individual to fungal infections. This 10-year-old girl has been on oral steroids for a while, making her more susceptible to such infections. Laryngeal candidiasis is a fungal infection that affects the larynx and can cause hoarseness of the voice. Infective tonsillitis, laryngeal edema, allergic drug reaction, and Ludwigs angina are all possible causes of hoarseness, but given the girl's medical history, laryngeal candidiasis is the most likely cause.",a,a,TRUE,
82. a lady with breast cancer has undergone axillary ln clearance. she develops arm swelling after being stung by a bee. what is the most likely mechanism responsible for the swelling?,a. lymphedema,b. cellulitis,c. hypersensitivity reaction,d. dvt,e. fluid retention,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is a. lymphoedema. key: 2. reason is compromised lymphatic drainage of arm due to axillary ln clearance. so if there is any inflammation or swelling, lymph drainage is compromised further giving rise to swelling of limb of that operated side.","The most likely mechanism responsible for the arm swelling in this scenario is lymphedema which is caused by compromised lymphatic drainage due to axillary lymph node clearance. This results in a higher susceptibility to inflammation or swelling, leading to a compromised lymphatic drainage which further exacerbates the swelling of the operated limb. Cellulitis, hypersensitivity reactions, and DVT are unlikely to be the cause since they don't involve the lymphatic system. Fluid retention, while a possibility, is less likely to cause sudden arm swelling in the absence of other factors. Therefore, the correct answer is a, lymphedema, due to the compromised lymphatic drainage resulting from the axillary lymph node clearance.",a,a,TRUE,
83. a 34yo pt presents with 50% partial thickness burns. what should be the most appropriate management?,a. iv fluids calculated from the time of hospital arrival,b. iv fluids calculated from the time of burn,c. no ivf,d. iv dextrose stat,e. burns ointment,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. iv fluids calculated from the time of burn. key: 2. resuscitation fluids required in the first 24 hours from the time of injury. for adults: 3 ml (in partial thickness burn) of hartmann’s solution/kg body weight/% total body surface area. half of this calculated volume is given in the first 8 hours and the other half is given over the following 16 hours.,"The most appropriate management for a 34-year-old patient with 50% partial thickness burns would be to administer IV fluids calculated from the time of burn, as indicated by option B. This is because fluid resuscitation is crucial in the management of burn injuries, as it helps prevent shock, maintain organ perfusion, and prevent complications associated with fluid shifts. The amount of IV fluids required in the first 24 hours from the time of injury should be calculated based on the patient's weight and % total body surface area using the formula - 3ml of Hartmann's solution/kg body weight/% total body surface area. Half of the calculated volume should be given in the first 8 hours and the other half over the following 16 hours. Options C and D are incorrect as the patient requires IV fluids, and option E is not a management option for burn injuries. In conclusion, option B is the correct answer as it recommends the appropriate management of fluid resuscitation in a patient with partial thickness burns.",b,b,TRUE,

[sertraline is the drug of choice in post mi as citalopram may be a risk factor for precipitating torsades-de-pointes. but if sertraline is not in option second choice is citalopram and where ssris are not suitable next choice is mirtazapine].,"The drug of choice for a 54-year-old man with moderate depression, a history of myocardial infarction, and insomnia would be sertraline. However, if sertraline is not available as an option, citalopram may be used as a second choice. It is important to note that citalopram may be a risk factor for precipitating torsades-de-pointes, which is why sertraline is preferred. If SSRIs are not suitable or effective for the patient, the next choice would be mirtazapine. Choices b, c, d, and e are not appropriate for this patient as lofepramine and ECT are not commonly used for moderate depression, haloperidol is an antipsychotic used for treating psychosis and agitation, and diazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and panic disorders.",a,a,TRUE,
85. a man presented with cellulitis and swelling. he was started on flucloxacillin. what other medication do you want to add?,a. vancomycin,b. penicillin,c. metronidazole,d. ceftriaxone,e. amoxicillin,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. penicillin. key: 2. cellulitis is usually caused by staphylococcus and streptococcus. to cover both flucloxacillin (for staphylococcus) and penicillin (to cover streptococci) should be prescribed.,"The correct answer to this question is B, penicillin. Cellulitis is usually caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria. Flucloxacillin is effective against Staphylococcus, but to cover possible Streptococcus infection, Penicillin should also be prescribed. 

The other medication choices are not suitable for use in cellulitis. Vancomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used for severe infections caused by resistant strains of bacteria. Metronidazole is an antibiotic used for infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used for bacterial infections, but not for cellulitis. Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that could be used to treat cellulitis, but as the patient is already receiving flucloxacillin, adding another beta-lactam antibiotic like amoxicillin would not be effective. Therefore, the correct answer is B, penicillin, as it is effective against Streptococcus bacteria and so complements the treatment provided by flucloxacillin.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the probable diagnosis for these symptoms is meningitis, wherein ceftriaxone is the drug of choice in hospital management. The other choices, penicillin, gentamicin, tazobactam, and meropenem, are either not effective or not recommended for meningitis treatment. Therefore, ceftriaxone is the most suitable empirical antibiotic to be started for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,

Blood culture. The presence of a systolic murmur and fever in a patient with a prosthetic heart valve is concerning for infective endocarditis. Blood culture is the next investigation required to ascertain the cause of HF in this case, as it will reveal the presence of any bacterial or fungal infections causing endocarditis. CT, ECG, MRI, and radioactive thyroid scan are not appropriate investigations for diagnosing infective endocarditis and HF. Therefore, they are not the correct choices. It is important to diagnose and treat infective endocarditis promptly, as it can cause severe complications such as heart failure, septic emboli, and even death.",b,b,TRUE,
88. a 45yo man with posterior gastric ulcer presented with severe excruciating pain which subsided after conservative treatment. 10 days later he developed swinging pyrexia. us shows a collection in the peritoneum. what will be the most likely location of the collection?,a. hepatorenal puch,b. left paracolic gutter,c. subphrenic,d. pelvic cavity,e. lesser sac,,,,,,key: the key is e. lesser sac.,"Based on the information provided, the most likely location of the collection seen on ultrasound is the lesser sac. The fact that the patient had a posterior gastric ulcer suggests that the collection is located behind the stomach, which is where the lesser sac is located. The other choices are less likely because they are not directly related to the location of the ulcer or the peritoneal collection. The hepatorenal pouch and left paracolic gutter are located further away from the stomach, while a pelvic cavity collection would be less likely given the location of the ulcer. The subphrenic region is a possible location, but the information provided does not suggest this as the most likely location. Therefore, the correct answer is e, the lesser sac.",e,e,TRUE,
89. a 23yo lady was prescribed with azithromycin 1gm for her chlamydial pelvic infection. she has got a new boyfriend for the last 2 months. she has recently started contraception to avoid conception. which of the following contraception method will be affected by azithromycin?,a. barrier,b. iucd,c. pop,d. cocp,,,,,,,"key: none of them! before it was thought that hepatic enzyme inhibitor drugs may affect cocp but later it was established that actually there is no such significant effect. only drugs  like refumpicin, rifabutin etc. can cause this. [for exam purpose if you have to choose one please choose d. cocp].","According to current research, none of the contraceptive methods are significantly affected by hepatic enzyme inhibitor drugs. Therefore, option D (Cocp) should not be chosen as the answer to the given question. The correct answer is option C (POP) because azithromycin can decrease the effectiveness of progestogen-only pills. It should be noted that options A (Barrier) and B (IUCD) are not affected by azithromycin. It is important for the patient to consult with her healthcare provider for further guidance on effective contraception while taking azithromycin.",d,d,TRUE,

[skipping meals, unhappy at school these are psychological issues. so he should be referred to clinical psychologist].","The correct answer is d. clinical psychologist. This is because the boy is experiencing psychological issues such as being unhappy at school and skipping meals, which may be indicative of mental health problems that require the attention and expertise of a clinical psychologist. Referring him to a general practitioner (a) or a pediatrician (b) may not address the underlying psychological issues. Whilst a dietician (c) can help with meal planning and nutritional advice, their role does not involve addressing mental health concerns. Therefore, the best course of action is to refer the boy to a clinical psychologist who can provide specialized psychological interventions and support.",d,d,TRUE,

CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is the most appropriate first line therapy for a 35yo man who presents with lack of interest in enjoyable activities and feeling low, as well as a belief that there is violence everywhere, given his symptoms of mild depressive illness. CBT is a form of talk therapy that helps individuals recognize and change negative thought patterns and behaviors, and it has been found to be an effective treatment for mild depressive illness. Medications such as citalopram or lofepramine may also be options for treatment, but they are not necessarily first line therapies and are not the best option for all individuals. Similarly, chlordiazepoxide and desensitization are not effective treatments for mild depressive illness and are not appropriate options for this individual.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because a femoral hernia's protrusion occurs just below the inguinal ligament and is not visible through the deep ring. The other choices are incorrect because a direct inguinal hernia (option a) protrudes directly through the deep ring, while an indirect inguinal hernia (option b) presents with the absence of a cough impulse on occlusion of the deep ring. Spigelian hernia (option d) is uncommon and affects the lateral abdominal wall, and lumbar hernia (option e) involves the lumbar region and presents with a bulge in the lower back. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for this man is femoral hernia, and he should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.",c,c,TRUE,

This is supported by the presence of dysphagia for both food and drink, as well as the air-fluid level seen on CXR behind a normal sized heart. Differentiating it from hiatus hernia, achalasia rarely presents with acid reflux or associated GORD, and there may be no nausea or vomiting as seen in hiatus hernia. Pharyngeal pouch is also unlikely as it usually presents with halitosis, which is not mentioned in this case. The symptoms in bulbar palsy would typically be different and would require additional findings for a diagnosis. Finally, although TB is a possible consideration, the symptoms and findings described in this case are more suggestive of achalasia.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because absorption of fluid used for bladder irrigation to flush out blood clots and IV fluids can lead to hypervolemia and dilutional hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is a condition in which there is a low level of sodium in the blood, and it can cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma. Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia are not typically associated with surgery for BPH, and hyperkalemia and hypernatremia are unlikely due to the nature of the surgery. Therefore, hyponatremia is the correct answer and is highly likely to occur in this scenario.",d,d,TRUE,

Migraine. The patient presents with severe right sided headache, nausea, and photo-phobia, which are key criteria for migraine without aura. According to the given criteria, a patient must have at least 5 headaches lasting 4-72 hours, along with nausea/vomiting (or photo/phono-phobia) and any two of the following: unilateral, pulsating, worsens by routine activity. Therefore, it is clear that the most likely diagnosis in this case is migraine without aura. SAH, brain tumor, cluster headache, and subdural headache are all less likely given the presentation and lack of additional findings.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the USG diagnostic criteria for ADPKD (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) can be used to assess the number of cysts in the kidneys based on the patient’s age. According to the criteria, patients aged 18-39 years with >3 unilateral or bilateral cysts in their kidneys are diagnosed with ADPKD. In contrast, CT scanning (C) or renal biopsy (D) may also provide helpful information, but they are more invasive procedures that carry a higher risk of complications. Cystoscopy (A) and urine analysis (E) are not relevant to the diagnosis of ADPKD as they focus on the bladder and urinary tract, respectively. Therefore, USG is the most diagnostic inv for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient's low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score indicates that he is not able to protect his own airway, and there is a risk of aspiration that can cause serious respiratory complications. Therefore, immediate intervention is crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition. Options a and b, which involve imaging studies, should be considered after the patient's airway is secured. Option c, providing IV fluids, may be necessary in the resuscitation process but is not the priority at this stage. Option d, skull XR, is not the appropriate intervention as it focuses on evaluating the head injury, but the airway should be secured first and other interventions should only be considered once the patient's airway is stabilized.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because hematuria is a significant symptom of bladder cancer, and cystoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic test for detecting bladder cancer. A mid-stream urine for culture would not provide any diagnostic information concerning bladder cancer, while an IVU and a transrectal US would not be useful in detecting bladder cancer. In addition, the history of ADPKD, which is a condition characterized by the development of cysts in the kidney, is also an important risk factor for the development of urinary tract cancers. Therefore, in this case, urgent referral for cystoscopy is the most appropriate next step to rule out bladder cancer.",c,c,TRUE,

The gradual decrease of visual acuity over the last 3 years and resulting disability due to very low vision points towards retinitis pigmentosa which is a genetic disorder that affects the retina and causes a slow progression of vision loss, often leading to legal blindness. Options b, c, and e are unlikely as they occur usually in elderly or have different symptoms. While option a, glaucoma, is a possibility, it is not the most likely answer as visual loss in glaucoma is not evenly gradual, rather it occurs suddenly at a later stage.

At this stage of labor, the cervix is undergoing softening and opening, with contractions becoming more frequent and regular. In this scenario, the woman's cervical dilation is 2cm, indicating the initial phase of the first stage. The other choices are incorrect as they refer to different stages of labor. The second stage starts once the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the delivery of the baby. The latent stage refers to the early phase of the first stage, where cervical dilation is between 0-3 cm.

The child's presentation and history are consistent with a breath holding spell, which is a common occurrence in young children and not associated with any underlying pathology. The child's fall and injury likely triggered the spell, causing a sudden drop in heart rate and oxygen levels. A CT head, EEG, CBC, or skeletal survey are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of head trauma or other associated symptoms or risk factors.

DIC is a serious blood-clotting disorder that results from an underlying medical condition or complication, such as severe infection, cancer, or in this case, obstetric complications. Placental abruption, which is a sudden separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, can cause DIC due to the release of tissue factor and other pro-coagulant substances into the bloodstream. This leads to widespread activation of clotting factors, resulting in the formation of small blood clots throughout the body, which can cause organ dysfunction and bleeding. Retained products of conception (choice A) can also cause postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), but this is less likely in this case since the fetus was already delivered vaginally. Fibroid uterus (choice C), uterine infection (choice D), and large placental site (choice E) are not predisposing factors for DIC or PPH, and therefore not the correct answer.",b,b,TRUE,
103. a 28yo woman has delivered with rotational forceps after an 8h labor and 3h second stage. choose the single most likely predisposing factor for pph for this pt?,a. atonic uterus,b. cervical/vaginal trauma,c. retained product,d. preterm labor,e. uterine infection,,,,,,key: the key is b. cervical/vaginal trauma. [complication of forceps delivery].,"The most likely predisposing factor for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in this 28-year-old woman who delivered with rotational forceps after an 8-hour labor and 3-hour second stage is cervical/vaginal trauma (choice b). This is a common complication of forceps delivery and can cause significant bleeding. Atonic uterus (choice a) is also a risk factor for PPH, but it is less likely in this case since the patient had a successful vaginal delivery with the use of forceps. Retained product (choice c) and preterm labor (choice d) are not applicable in this scenario. Uterine infection (choice e) could potentially be a cause of PPH, but it is not as likely as cervical/vaginal trauma in this case since the patient had a prolonged second stage of labor and the use of forceps can increase the risk of trauma. Therefore, cervical/vaginal trauma is the correct answer as it is the most likely predisposing factor for PPH in this particular scenario.",b,b,TRUE,
104. a 50yo man has had anterior resection of the rectum for carcinoma. he expressed concerns about control of post-op pain in discussions with the anaesthetist before surgery. what is the best management strategy?,a. oral diclofenac,b. oral codeine,c. im morphine,d. im dihydrocodeine,e. ondansetron oral,,,,,,key: the key is c. im morphine. [some post operative pain is severe pain which needs strong opioid analgesics].,"The correct answer is c, IM morphine. Some postoperative pain can be severe, and it requires strong opioid analgesics to manage it effectively. The patient in this case just underwent anterior resection of the rectum for carcinoma and had expressed concerns about managing their postoperative pain. Oral diclofenac and oral codeine may not provide adequate pain relief in severe cases, and im dihydrocodeine may not be as effective as morphine. Ondansetron is not an analgesic and does not address the patient's pain concerns. Therefore, IM morphine is the best management strategy to manage the patient's postoperative pain effectively.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the patient's clinical presentation is consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is characterized by the accumulation of mature but functionally defective lymphocytes in the blood and lymphoid tissues. The other choices are unlikely to be present on the blood film in this context, as granulocytes without blast cells could suggest a myeloproliferative disorder, myelofibroblasts could indicate bone marrow fibrosis, and plasma cells are more commonly found in multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasias. Therefore, the presence of mature lymphocytes on the blood film is the most indicative of CLL for this patient.",d,d,TRUE,

The irregularly irregular pulse, along with the fixed splitting and loud p2, is typical for ASD. The ejection systolic murmur in the left 2nd intercostal space (ICS) confirms the diagnosis. It is important not to misdiagnose the sob and ejection systolic murmur in the pulmonary area as pulmonary hypertension, which can develop with ASD in elderly patients. The other choices for the probable diagnosis, including tof, vsd, pda, and coa, do not have the specific combination of symptoms described in this case and are incorrect.",b,b,TRUE,
107. a 5m baby present with recurrent vomiting. mother noticed some of the vomitus is blood stained. choose the single most likely inv?,a. upper gi endoscopy,b. barium meal,c. us,d. colonoscopy,e. ct abdomen,,,,,,key: the key is a. upper gi endoscopy.,"The correct answer for the most likely investigation for a 5-month-old baby presenting with recurrent vomiting and blood-stained vomitus is a. upper GI endoscopy. This is because upper GI endoscopy allows direct visualization of the upper GI tract, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, to identify any possible causes of the vomiting. Other options such as barium meal, US, colonoscopy, or CT abdomen are not the most appropriate choices in this case as they do not provide direct visualization of the upper GI tract. Barium meal is contraindicated in cases of suspected GI perforation or obstruction, which can be a possible complication in infants due to their small size. Ultrasound and CT abdomen are more useful in evaluating organs such as liver, spleen, and kidneys and are not well-suited for evaluating the upper GI tract. Additionally, colonoscopy should not be chosen as the first investigation for vomiting and blood-stained vomitus in infants. Therefore, upper GI endoscopy is the most appropriate choice for this case, allowing for accurate diagnosis and management of the underlying cause.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because thiazide diuretics like bendroflumethiazide can cause hyperuricemia, which in turn can cause or worsen gout, a condition characterized by painful inflammation in the joints, including the big toe joint. The other choices, losartan, ramipril, bisoprolol, and verapamil, are not known to cause or worsen gout. Therefore, they are not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
109. a 33yo male involved in a street fight presents with bruises and deformity in the upper part of his leg. xr shows fx of the neck of fibula. what is the single most associated nerve injury?,a. sciatic nerve,b. gluteal nerve,c. musculocutaneous nerve,d. lateral peroneal nerve,e. tibial nerve,f. femoral nerve,,,,,key: the key is d. lateral peroneal nerve.  [lateral peroneal nerve is other name of superficial peroneal nerve].,"The correct answer is D, lateral peroneal nerve. The lateral peroneal nerve travels around the neck of the fibula and is frequently injured in cases of fibular neck fractures. This results in foot drop, which is a characteristic weakness in dorsiflexion of the foot. The other nerves listed are not commonly associated with this type of injury and therefore are not the correct answer. Sciatic nerve injury is usually associated with low back pain or lower extremity weakness, while gluteal nerve injury may affect hip extension or abduction. Musculocutaneous nerve supplies the anterior compartment of the arm and is not related to the injury described. Tibial nerve injury typically results in plantar flexion weakness and loss of sensation in the sole of the foot. Femoral nerve injury results in quadriceps weakness and anterior thigh numbness.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because despite negative H. pylori antibodies and one month of treatment, the patient is not responding, which indicates the possibility of an underlying condition. The indications for gastroscopy in a 35-year-old man include acute symptoms with previous episodes (such as PUD), alarm features (such as weight loss, anemia, vomiting, hematemesis, and melaena, dysphagia, and palpable abdominal mass), fear of cancer, and evidence of organic disease. The other options, such as urea breath test, CT, or MRI, are not appropriate in this case since they do not provide a direct visualization of the digestive system, which is necessary to identify any potential underlying condition. Therefore, gastroscopy is the best option to identify any possible cause of the patient's dyspepsia, and appropriate treatment can be initiated accordingly.",b,b,TRUE,

MCD is a type of nephrotic syndrome that primarily affects children and is characterized by the sudden onset of peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria. In MCD, kidney biopsy often shows normal glomeruli under light microscopy, but effacement of podocyte foot processes is commonly observed under electron microscopy. Other choices such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), IgA nephropathy, and membranous glomerulonephritis are less likely due to the age of the patient and the absence of their characteristic features. The treatment of choice for MCD is steroids (prednisolone), with cyclophosphamide reserved for patients with frequent relapses or steroid resistance.",d,d,TRUE,
"112. a 28yo man has developed a red, raised rash on trunk after playing football. his pmh shows he had childhood asthma. the rash is becoming increasingly itchy. what is the most appropriate tx?",a. oral chlorpheneraime,b. oral amoxicillin,c. im adrenaline,d. nebulized salbutamol,e. histamine,,,,,,key: 1. the key is a. oral chlorpheneramine. key: 2. diagnosis is atopy (allergy).,"The correct answer to this question would be a. oral chlorpheneramine. Based on the patient's history of childhood asthma and the development of a rash that is becoming progressively itchy, it is likely that the individual is experiencing an allergic reaction. Chlorpheneramine is an antihistamine that can help alleviate allergy symptoms such as itching and hives. Oral amoxicillin would not be appropriate in this scenario since there is no indication of a bacterial infection. IM adrenaline is typically reserved for severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, and nebulized salbutamol is used to treat asthma symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath, which are not present in this patient. Histamine nan nan nan nan nan does not make sense as a potential treatment option. Therefore, oral chlorpheneramine is the most appropriate choice for this individual's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[mitral stenosis is the most common valvular complication of rheumatic fever].,"The most probable diagnosis for the 72-year-old man is mitral valve stenosis (choice E). Mitral stenosis is more prevalent in patients with a history of rheumatic fever, and breathlessness on exertion and orthopnea are common symptoms of mitral valve stenosis. Additionally, the patient's pulse is normal, which is another indication of mitral valve stenosis since this condition may not cause changes in the pulse. The other choices (aortic regurgitation, ischemic mitral regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse, and pulmonary stenosis) are unlikely since they do not present with the same symptoms as mitral valve stenosis, and the patient's age may not be relevant to these conditions. It is essential to determine the correct diagnosis since mitral valve stenosis requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications.",e,e,TRUE,

The given patient presents with fatigue and angular stomatitis, and we know that the absence of koilonychea is against iron deficiency anemia. This information supports the idea that the cause of the fatigue could be a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, which can lead to macrocytic anemia. Thus, when we examine a blood film from this patient, we would expect to see larger-than-normal red blood cells, or macrocytes. The other answer choices are unlikely because granulocytes without blast cells would not provide meaningful information about the type of anemia, and blast cells would be indicative of a more severe condition such as leukemia. Microcytes are associated with iron deficiency anemia, which is not supported by the absence of koilonychea. Therefore, the most likely cell type to be found on the blood film for this patient is macrocytes.",a,a,TRUE,
115. a 4yo boy with a febrile convulsion lasting eight minutes has been given iv lorazepam to control them. what is the single most likely serious side effect?,a. amnesia,b. anaphylactic shock,c. apnea,d. bronchospasm,e. cardiac arrhythmia,,,,,,key: the key is c. apnoea. [respiratory depression may occur following lorazepam administration].,"The correct answer is c, apnoea. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine medication that can cause respiratory depression, particularly when given intravenously. In a 4-year-old boy with febrile convulsions, the use of lorazepam is considered a first-line treatment to control the seizures. However, it is important to monitor the child closely for any signs of respiratory depression following administration of the medication. The other choices are not the most likely serious side effect in this case. Amnesia is a common side effect of lorazepam but not considered serious. Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction that can occur with any medication, but it is a rare side effect of lorazepam. Bronchospasm and cardiac arrhythmia are not common side effects of lorazepam and are not likely to occur in this case.",c,c,TRUE,

Breast milk jaundice is a condition in which a breastfed baby may have high levels of bilirubin causing yellowing of the skin and eyes. This condition is benign and self-limited, resolving spontaneously in a few weeks, and does not require any intervention. Therefore, options b, c, d, and e are incorrect. Exchange transfusion is an invasive procedure that carries significant risks and should only be used in severe cases of jaundice. Increasing fluid intake or stopping breastfeeding is not necessary and may even worsen the condition. Phototherapy, although effective, should be reserved for cases of pathological jaundice. Thus, the primary management of breast milk jaundice is to continue breastfeeding, which will provide numerous benefits to the baby's growth and development.",a,a,TRUE,

IM adrenaline is not recommended in mild allergic reactions, and IV antihistamine is only used in emergency situations like anaphylaxis. Oral ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic and does not provide any relief from bee stings. Reassurance is also not enough to manage the symptoms. Hence, the most appropriate management plan for the girl's condition is to give oral antihistamines to alleviate itching and reduce the number of wheals.",a,a,TRUE,
118. a term baby born to a 30yo woman of blood group a-ve develops severe jaundice within the first 24h of birth. what is the most likely dx?,a. hereditary spherocytosis,b. g6pd,c. abo incompatibility,d. rh incompatibility,e. physiological jaundice,,,,,,key: the key is d. rh incompatibility.,"The correct answer to this question is d. rh incompatibility. Rh incompatibility refers to a condition where the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive, leading to the production of antibodies by the mother that attack the baby's red blood cells. This can cause severe jaundice in the baby, as in this case where a term baby born to a 30-year-old woman of blood group A-negative develops severe jaundice within the first 24 hours of birth. Hereditary spherocytosis (a) and G6PD (b) are not typically associated with early onset jaundice. ABO incompatibility (c) can cause early onset jaundice, but this is more common in cases where the mother is O and the baby is A, B, or AB. Physiological jaundice (e) is mild and self-limiting and typically occurs later in the first week of life. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this baby's severe jaundice within the first 24 hours of birth is Rh incompatibility.",d,d,TRUE,

[continuous mechinary murmur is well known feature of pda].,"The most probable diagnosis for a 4-year-old girl with a bounding pulse and continuous machinery murmur is PDA, which stands for patent ductus arteriosus. This diagnosis is likely because a continuous machinery murmur is a well-known feature of PDA, which is a heart defect that occurs when the ductus arteriosus, a small blood vessel that connects the aorta and pulmonary artery in a fetus, fails to close properly after birth. This causes blood to flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, which results in a continuous murmur, along with symptoms such as a bounding pulse and shortness of breath. The other choices, such as TOF, ASD, VSD, and COA, do not typically present with a continuous machinery murmur and are thus less likely to be the correct diagnosis in this case.",d,d,TRUE,

The patient's symptoms and clinical examination findings are consistent with TOF, which is a congenital heart defect. TOF is characterized by four abnormalities in the cardiac anatomy, including ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding of the aorta, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The clinical features of TOF usually do not become symptomatic at birth or early infancy, but can present with episodes of sudden bluish discoloration and brief loss of consciousness later on, as seen in this patient. The presence of clubbing, central cyanosis, and systolic thrill with systolic ejection murmur in 2nd left ics are well-known features of TOF. Choices B, C, D, and E are all incorrect because they do not explain the constellation of symptoms and findings present in the patient.",a,a,TRUE,

Marfans syndrome. Marfans syndrome is characterized by tall stature, cardiovascular abnormalities, and ocular manifestations, including refractive errors for which glasses are required. The cause of severe crushing chest pain in this case may be aortic dissection, which is a common complication of Marfans syndrome. The most common cardiac abnormalities in Marfans syndrome include dilatation of the aorta and mitral regurgitation. Fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and DiGeorge syndrome are not associated with the symptoms described in this scenario, making them unlikely causes of the chest pain.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because the child presents with pain of spontaneous onset in the knee and has developed mild fever, which are typical signs of septic arthritis. Additionally, the painful restriction in the right hip is another point in favor of the diagnosis of septic arthritis, as it is a joint-related symptom. Osteosarcoma, TB arthritis, and exostosis are unlikely differential diagnoses as they are not typically associated with joint pain and fever. Osteomyelitis may present with bone pain but not joint pain, making it an incorrect answer in this case. Ultimately, based on the given information, septic arthritis is the most probable diagnosis for this 4-year-old child's symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,

[as many anastomotic leak is self limiting so laparotomy can not be the answer! definitive diagnosis is made by ct scan. here is one link attached. http://teachmesurgery.com/perioperative/gastrointestinal/anastomotic-leak/,"The correct answer to this question is C, CT. This is because a man with anterior resection and end to end anastomosis who complains of severe pain in the chest and abdominal distension likely has an anastomotic leak, which can be diagnosed definitively through a CT scan. This option is more appropriate compared to the other choices, which are not as effective for determining the cause of the man's deterioration. Xr abdomen and ultrasound are not sufficiently sensitive to detect an anastomotic leak, whereas an exploratory laparoscopy is an invasive procedure that should only be done as a last resort if the CT scan is inconclusive. The initial management of an anastomotic leak should be non-operative and conservative, with the CT scan used to make a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, CT is the most appropriate and practical option for reviewing the cause of the man's deterioration.",c,c,TRUE,

[these are features of wernicke’s encephalopathy].,"Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological disorder commonly found in people with a history of alcoholism. It is characterized by symptoms such as ataxic gait, hallucinations, and loss of memory. The key to treating this disorder is through the administration of vitamin B1 or thiamine. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Acamprosate is a medication used to treat alcohol dependence, but it does not address the root cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a deficiency in thiamine. Options A, C, D, and E are not recommended since they do not address the specific vitamin deficiency associated with this disorder. In conclusion, administering thiamine alongside acamprosate is the most effective combination of drugs to treat Wernicke's encephalopathy.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because NSAIDs are known to cause damage to the gastro-mucosal barrier, making the stomach lining more susceptible to ulcers. The abrupt onset of severe abdominal pain and rigid abdomen are also consistent with a perforated peptic ulcer. Biliary peritonitis, ischemic colon, pancreatic necrosis, and perforated diverticulum can also cause severe abdominal pain, but they are not as likely in this case given the specific patient history and presentation. Therefore, perforated peptic ulcer is the most likely diagnosis.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because the x-ray abdomen is a key diagnostic tool for identifying paralytic ileus, which is a likely diagnosis. This condition is characterized by the absence of bowel sounds, abdominal distension, and vomiting, and can be caused by several factors such as electrolyte imbalance, gastroenteritis, appendicitis, pancreatitis, surgical complications, and certain drugs. The management of paralytic ileus involves nil by mouth, nasogastric suction to alleviate the distension, and remove the obstruction. Exploratory laparoscopy (Option B) or CT (Option C) are not appropriate next steps at this stage, as they involve invasive procedures and radiation exposure, respectively. Similarly, USG (Option D) or Barium enema (Option E) may not provide the required information for diagnosis and management of paralytic ileus. Hence, the most appropriate next step is x-ray abdomen, which is a key diagnostic tool for paralytic ileus.",a,a,TRUE,
127. a 30yo man complains of hoarseness of voice. exam: unilateral immobile vocal cord. what is the most probable dx?,a. graves disease,b. hematoma,c. unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury,d. external laryngeal nerve injury,e. tracheomalacia,,,,,,key: the key is c. unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.,"The correct answer is C, unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. The recurrent laryngeal nerve controls the movement of the vocal cords, and its injury can result in hoarseness of voice as well as other symptoms such as weak voice, breathy voice, and difficulty swallowing. Graves disease, hematoma, external laryngeal nerve injury, and tracheomalacia are all conditions that can also affect the voice; however, they do not lead to unilateral immobile vocal cord which is the most probable finding in this case.

128. a 38yo woman has delivered after an induced labor which lasted 26h. choose the single most likely predisposing factor for postpartum hemorrhage?,a. atonic uterus,b. cervical/vaginal trauma,c. rupture uterus,d. fibroid uterus,e. age of mother,,,,,,key: the key is a. atonic uterus. [prolonged labour is a risk factor for pph secondary to atonic uterus].,"The single most likely predisposing factor for postpartum hemorrhage in a 38-year-old woman who has delivered after a 26-hour induced labor is a. atonic uterus. Atonic uterus refers to a uterus that has lost its tone and is unable to contract properly, leading to excessive bleeding during delivery. Prolonged labor is a risk factor for atonic uterus, which in turn increases the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Although cervical/vaginal trauma, rupture uterus, fibroid uterus, and age of mother may also contribute to postpartum hemorrhage, atonic uterus is the most likely factor in this case due to the prolonged labor history. Therefore, choice a is the correct answer, while options b, c, d, and e are less likely to be the primary cause of postpartum hemorrhage in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient's presentation and history suggest post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with symptoms of irritability, hyperarousal, nightmares, and associated depression. Nice guidelines recommend trauma-focused psychological therapies as the first-line treatment option, however, this is not currently an available option for the patient. Among the available pharmacological treatments, fluoxetine (SSRI) is the choice of drug for PTSD. Quetiapine may be used for PTSD but is not the best option in this case.

Anal hematoma and anal abscess are less likely since they typically present with acute pain, and protalgia fugax and hemorrhoids do not typically cause severe pain during defecation. An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anal canal that can occur due to constipation or trauma, and is characterized by sharp pain during defecation followed by relief. Treatment typically involves stool softeners, sitz baths, and sometimes surgery.",b,b,TRUE,

[for ocd cbt is the 1st treatment of choice and if fails comes drugs]. key: 2. the diagnosis is obsessive compulsive disorder.,"The best management for a patient with a thought disorder who washes their hands six times each time they use the toilet is option b, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This is because obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder that frequently presents itself with compulsive behaviors, such as excessive hand-washing. CBT is the first treatment of choice for OCD because it helps people to identify and challenge their negative or irrational thoughts and beliefs, ultimately reducing symptoms associated with those thoughts. Psychodynamic therapy (option a) may be helpful for other mental health problems, but it is not typically recommended as a primary treatment for OCD. Antipsychotic medications (option c) are more commonly used to treat schizophrenia and other conditions with psychotic symptoms, which are not present in this case. Referring the patient to dermatology (option d) would not address the underlying thought disorder causing the compulsive behavior. Lastly, reassuring the patient (option e) without offering any form of psychological intervention would not be effective in treating OCD.",b,b,TRUE,

In the UK, a 25-year-old woman is offered her first cervical smear and considering the patient's age and symptoms, a smear is the best course of action. It is important to note that the cervical smear is a screening service which follows its own schedule and can only be done when it is due or overdue. Endometrial ablation, antibiotics, colposcopy, vaginal US, and packing with gauze and leaving it to dry are not suitable options for managing cervical ectropion with mild contact bleeding. Therefore, the best choice is cervical smear.",b,b,TRUE,
134. a 32yo had a normal vaginal delivery 10 days ago. her uterus has involuted normally. choose the single most likely predisposing factor for pph?,a. retained product,b. dic,c. uterine infection,d. von willebrand disease,e. primary pph,,,,,,key: 1. the key is c. uterine infection. key: 2. secondary pph,"The correct answer for the single most likely predisposing factor for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in a 32-year-old woman who had a normal vaginal delivery 10 days ago is c. uterine infection. Uterine infection, also known as endometritis, is a common cause of PPH which occurs due to the inflammation and weakening of the uterus. This can lead to poor uterine contractions, ineffective blood clotting and poor response to uterotonics, all of which can result in excessive bleeding. Retained products (a) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (b) can also cause PPH, but they usually present earlier than 10 days postpartum. Von Willebrand disease (d) is a rare genetic bleeding disorder that may present as PPH but is unlikely in this scenario. Primary PPH (e) occurs within the first 24 hours after delivery and is less likely than secondary PPH in this case. Therefore, uterine infection is the most plausible answer, and appropriate management with antibiotics and close monitoring should be initiated.",c,c,TRUE,

When a person falls on their outstretched hand, an injury to the radial nerve can occur at the wrist, causing finger drop. The radial nerve supplies the muscles responsible for extending the wrist and fingers, which are commonly affected in this type of injury. The root value of the radial nerve is C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1. This means that the nerve roots originating from these spinal levels combine to form the radial nerve. Musculocutaneous nerve, median nerve, and ulnar nerve are not typically associated with a fracture of the head of radius. Therefore, the most likely nerve injury in this scenario is the radial nerve.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the butcher's pulse rate is between 120-140 bpm, his systolic blood pressure is decreased, and his respiratory rate is between 30-40 breaths per minute. Additionally, his urine output is between 5-15 ml/hour, which aligns with class 3 characteristics. The other answer choices are incorrect because the butcher's symptoms do not align with those classifications - his blood pressure and pulse rate are too low for options d and e, for example. Therefore, answer c is the best choice based on the information provided.",c,c,TRUE,

This option is the correct answer as it offers the patient professional care and treatment in a controlled environment, where he can receive the necessary medical and psychological attention he needs. Handing over to a social worker (option b) may not provide the level of care required to manage his depression and neglect. Requesting the son to move in with his father (option c) may not be practical, depending on the son's personal circumstances, and may not address the patient's medical needs. Sending the patient to a care home (option d) may also not offer the psychiatric care and treatment the patient requires to overcome his depression. Therefore, voluntary admission to a psychiatry ward is the most suitable management option for the patient in question.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the presentation of bilateral cavitating consolidation favours Staphylococcus as the causative agent. While staphylococci can be both coagulase positive and coagulase negative, the fact that the key mentions coagulase positive points to S. aureus. Gram positive diplococcic is pneumococcus and gram negative cocci like Nisseria, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Hemophilus influenza are not likely to cause cavitating consolidation. AFB (acid-fast bacilli) would present with low grade evening fever with night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, and other symptoms.

This is because atherosclerosis affects the arteries leading to the legs and can cause pain in the thigh and gluteal region when walking. The other options, such as sciatica, DVT, thromboangitis obliterans, and embolus, are not the correct diagnosis in this case as they exhibit different symptoms that do not fit the patient's condition. For example, sciatica pain becomes worse when sitting, while DVT shows swelling, warmth, and redness of skin. Thromboangitis obliterans reflects a change in pulse, skin color, hair growth, and ulceration, whereas embolism is associated with rest pain, numbness, and skin rash or ulceration. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, atherosclerosis is the most appropriate diagnosis for their condition.",d,d,TRUE,

The reason why other choices are wrong is as follows: choice a, the sweat chloride test, is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is incorrect as the question specifically states that the child does not have lung problems. Choice c, liver function tests, are not helpful in diagnosing celiac disease. Choice d, ultrasound of the abdomen, may show changes in the bowel, but it is not the single most likely test to diagnose celiac disease. Choice e, thyroid function tests, are not relevant to the symptoms described.

MRI is the preferred imaging study to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is the likely diagnosis in this case due to the patient’s symptoms of pain in the eye, blurry vision, clumsiness, difficulty in swallowing and weakness in the right upper limb. CSF analysis may also be used to aid in diagnosis, but it would not be the initial test of choice. EEG and EMG are not useful in diagnosing MS.

This choice is supported by the diagnostic features of increased number of mature granulocytes and huge splenomegaly, which are characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The other options are not supported by the information provided in the question or are specific to other conditions. Helmet shaped cells (or schistocytes) are associated with hemolytic or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and sickle cells are characteristic of sickle cell anemia.

ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura). The lab values of a high white blood cell count (wbc=25) and positive Paul Bunnel test suggest glandular fever, but bruising is not a typical symptom of the virus. Trauma is unlikely to explain the consistently low platelet count (plt=45). NAI (Non-Accidental Injury) or septicemia may present with bruising, but the lab values are not consistent with those diagnoses either.

This procedure involves placing particles in the uterine artery to block circulation to the uterine body, ultimately reducing heavy bleeding. It is a minimally invasive procedure that does not require open surgery or general anesthesia, making it an attractive option for the patient who wishes to avoid these types of interventions. Options A, B, C, and D all involve some form of surgery, which the patient has expressed a desire to avoid. Endometrial ablation involves removing the lining of the uterus, while hysterectomy, fibroid resection, and myomectomy all involve removal of the uterus or specific growths.

The presence of stridor and wheeze are suggestive of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Adrenaline is a safe and effective treatment for anaphylaxis, as it helps to reverse airway constriction, reduce inflammation, and improve blood pressure. PO adrenaline (option b) would not be appropriate, as it is not absorbed quickly enough to provide rapid relief. IV adrenaline (option c) is reserved for severe cases and should only be administered by a healthcare professional. IV chlorphenamine (option d) is an antihistamine that can help to alleviate symptoms such as itching and hives, but it is not a first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.

This is supported by several points in favor, including the stab wound in the back, sob, engorged neck veins, and absent breath sounds on the right. While some of these features are common for both hemothorax and tension pneumothorax, the absence of tracheal deviation makes hemothorax less likely. Cardiac tamponade, simple pneumothorax, and pleural effusion are also unlikely diagnoses based on the presented symptoms. It is important to note that the presence of common features between different diagnoses can increase the probability of bad recall, so a careful evaluation of all symptoms is necessary to make an accurate diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

The presence of left-sided ptosis and left dilated pupil indicates a lesion in the midbrain, specifically in the area known as Weber syndrome. Weber syndrome is characterized by the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy, which causes the ptosis and dilation of the pupil on the same side as the lesion, and contralateral hemiparesis, which is the right-sided weakness in this case. Options a, b, c, and d are all incorrect because they are not associated with the specific symptoms found in this patient. Cerebral infarct, cerebellar infarct, medulla oblongata, and pons would result in different symptoms, making them all incorrect choices.",e,e,TRUE,

Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart, causing compression and resulting in a decreased cardiac output, which explains the low blood pressure, high pulse, and faint heart sounds. The dilated neck veins are a result of the increased pressure in the superior vena cava due to the compression of the heart. Diaphragmatic rupture, fractured ribs, and traumatic rupture of the aorta would not explain the constellation of the presenting symptoms, and tension pneumothorax would typically present with tracheal deviation away from the site of injury rather than central trachea. Therefore, cardiac tamponade is the most likely diagnosis based on the presentation of the patient.",a,a,TRUE,

This 15-year-old boy has symptoms of varicocele, which is a common condition in adolescent boys. Varicocele is the enlargement of veins within the scrotum that drains blood from the testicles. It is usually painless but can cause discomfort or a dull ache. In this case, the swelling is soft, painless, and compressible which is consistent with varicocele. Antibiotics are unnecessary because this is not an infectious process. Biopsy is also not necessary because this is a benign condition that does not require pathological examination. Immediate surgery is not indicated because varicocele is not an emergency and can be monitored over time. Reassurance should be provided to the patient and his family, along with education and follow-up with a urologist or primary care physician.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because the patient is showing signs of severe dehydration, including low urine output, dry mucous membranes, and low skin turgor. Antibiotics (option A) would not be appropriate as diarrhea is most commonly caused by viruses and bacteria, which antibiotics are ineffective against in most cases. Antimotility (option B) and anti-emetic (option C) medications may offer symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying dehydration and may even be contraindicated in some cases. Reassurance (option E) would also not be enough, as the patient requires immediate intervention to address their severe dehydration. Therefore, fluid replacement is the most appropriate initial management in this case.",d,d,TRUE,

Intermittent claudication is a symptom, not a diagnosis, and while it may be present in patients with chronic ischemia of the limbs, it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Buerger's disease typically occurs in younger, heavy smokers and is not likely in a 60-year-old patient. DVT pain or tenderness does not typically exhibit an intermittent claudication pattern, making that diagnosis less likely. DM does not typically involve intermittent claudication either. Therefore, chronic ischemia of the limbs is the most probable diagnosis for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

This is a genetic disorder that causes episodes of swelling throughout the body, including the face, tongue, and abdomen. The other choices (B) HIV, (C) mumps, (D) sarcoidosis, and (E) Sjogren's syndrome, are unlikely to cause the symptoms described in the patient. HIV does not typically present with recurring episodes of swelling, mumps usually causes swelling of the salivary glands and not the face or tongue, sarcoidosis rarely causes swelling, and Sjogren's syndrome primarily affects the eyes and mouth. Therefore, C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is the most likely diagnosis, especially given the positive family history for similar episodes.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient's complaint of intermittent vaginal bleeding, combined with a history of manual removal of the placenta, and a raised temperature, all point towards an infective process like endometritis. Retained POC (product of conception) would not be the most appropriate complication as the patient had already undergone manual removal of the placenta. Aspiration pneumonitis, uterine rupture, and DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) are all unlikely based on the information provided. Endometritis, which is inflammation of the uterine lining due to infection, is a common post-C-section complication and the most likely diagnosis in this case.",c,c,TRUE,

This diagnosis is supported by the fact that a normal rectal examination and flexible sigmoidoscopy rules out other possible options, such as anal hematoma, anal fissure, rectal carcinoma, and piles. Proctalgia fugax is a relatively benign condition that involves fleeting rectal pain that lasts for seconds to minutes and is not associated with any structural abnormalities. It is unclear what causes proctalgia fugax, but it is thought to be related to muscle spasm in the pelvic floor. While the pain can be severe, it does not require any specific treatment and is generally self-limiting. In summary, a normal rectal examination and flexible sigmoidoscopy make proctalgia fugax the most likely diagnosis, and the other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,

[sciatic nerve injury though may occur but may not be very common!],"The correct answer is a. sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and runs through the hip and down the leg. When a femoral neck fracture occurs, there is a risk of damage to the surrounding nerves. The sciatic nerve is the most commonly associated nerve injury due to its proximity to the femoral neck. Damage to the sciatic nerve can cause weakness or numbness in the leg and foot. The other choices listed are less commonly associated with femoral neck fractures and are not the single most associated nerve injury.",a,a,TRUE,

Although there may be debate on whether pain relief should be given first, it is important to prioritize oxygen therapy as it can prevent further complications that may arise from inadequate oxygenation. Antibiotics (option A) may be necessary in certain cases where there is presence of infection, but it is not the initial priority. Analgesia (option B) and physiotherapy (option D) can be administered as supportive measures once the patient's oxygenation has been stabilized. Referral to a surgeon (option E) may also be necessary depending on the extent of the injury. In summary, administering oxygen via mask should be the initial intervention in this patient due to the potential risk of inadequate oxygenation.",c,c,TRUE,

COA is a congenital heart defect that results in a narrowing of the aorta, leading to increased blood pressure and reduced blood flow to certain areas of the body. Headache and nosebleeds are common symptoms of hypertension, which results from COA. The pain in his lower limbs on exertion is due to reduced blood supply to his legs. The radio-femoral delay, cold legs with a weak pulse, and mild systolic murmur are all features of COA.

This is because low blood glucose levels can easily be managed and require urgent attention to prevent fatal outcomes. If low blood glucose is excluded as a cause, then other investigations such as CT or MRI can be considered for identifying potential underlying conditions. However, these investigations may not be necessary in the first instance, as the immediate priority is to stabilize the patient's blood glucose levels. Serum drug level testing is also a possibility, but only if there is suspicion or evidence of drug use as a cause of the seizure. Therefore, of the options given, serum blood glucose testing is the most appropriate investigation to prioritize in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,

Urticaria is a skin condition that manifests as itchy, pink or red raised welts that may appear suddenly on the skin. The patient's symptoms of recent onset of itching that followed a viral infection and the presence of numerous wheals of all sizes on his skin support the diagnosis of urticaria, especially since the wheals last up to an hour. Uremia, psychogenic itching, atopic eczema, and primary biliary cirrhosis may all present with itching, but they do not fit the patient's symptoms as well as urticaria does. Uremia is a condition caused by kidney failure, and itching is a common symptom, but the patient does not have any other signs of uremia. Psychogenic itching is caused by psychological factors, and atopic eczema is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, scaly patches. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a liver disease that can cause itching, but it is rare in a 20-year-old male and there is no other evidence of liver disease in this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

Mitral valve replacement may not necessarily cause any of these symptoms but tricuspid regurgitation can occur as a result of surgery. Aortic regurgitation and pulmonary stenosis lead to different symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath with exercise respectively. Mitral regurgitation and stenosis may lead to breathlessness and fatigue but generally do not cause the given symptoms. Therefore, tricuspid regurgitation is the most probable diagnosis in this case.

This patient has pre-proliferative retinopathy as evidenced by dot and blot hemorrhage, hard exudate, and cotton wool spots. These findings do not require urgent referral for laser therapy as seen in proliferative retinopathy with neovascularization. Annual follow-up with an ophthalmologist is recommended to monitor for progression and determine if laser therapy is needed in the future. Reassurance and annual screening only (answer choice A) is not appropriate for this level of retinopathy and doing nothing (answer choice E) is not an option, as diabetic retinopathy left untreated can lead to vision loss and blindness.",d,d,TRUE,

This is supported by the fact that the symptoms presented are consistent with salt-wasting adrenal hyperplasia, a type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which causes ambiguous genitalia and inadequate synthesis of cortisol. Additionally, hyperkalemia despite vomiting suggests that the disease is causing renal failure or hormonal imbalances that can lead to life-threatening complications. The other choices, fragile X syndrome, Turner's Syndrome, and Noonan Syndrome, do not present with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia as symptoms and are therefore less likely diagnoses.",d,d,TRUE,

While diabetes (option B), heart failure (option C), pulmonary embolism (option D), and renal failure (option E) are all serious medical conditions that can contribute to premature death, a history of diabetes and obesity significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, including MI. Additionally, the fact that the patient collapsed and died suddenly is consistent with the acute onset of MI symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating. Therefore, based on the patient's medical history and clinical presentation, MI is the most likely cause of death.",a,a,TRUE,

Additionally, the symptom of laryngospasm causing stridor is characteristic of hypocalcemia. The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the patient's symptoms and history. Thyroid storm would present with hyperthyroid symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and sweating, which are not mentioned in the case. Hyperparathyroidism would result in elevated calcium levels rather than decreased.

COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease characterized by progressive airflow limitations that result in difficulty breathing. The age, chronic smoking history, respiratory symptoms, and laboratory findings all support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely since they do not fit with the presented case, for example, interstitial lung disease would present with different symptoms and findings on CXR, ABG, and other tests, while CA bronchi would require additional tests such as biopsy or CT scan to confirm.

Prolonged pressure on the trachea caused by a goiter can lead to tracheomalacia following a thyroidectomy. Thyroid storm is unlikely to cause these symptoms so soon after extubation, and hematoma would typically be associated with localized swelling, bruising, and pressure effects. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury may cause hoarseness and vocal cord paralysis, but not stridor. External laryngeal nerve injury would only affect the vocal cords and not the trachea.

MCD is characterized by increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane leading to proteinuria, often with associated edema. Unlike in other forms of glomerulonephritis, patients with MCD usually have no hematuria, and the eGFR is often normal. IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, PSGN and lupus nephritis are unlikely given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.

[it is the treatment of chemotherapy induced leucopenia].,"The most appropriate management for this patient would be a. broad spectrum antibiotics iv. The patient has symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, which in the context of receiving chemotherapy, increases the risk of bacterial pneumonia. The coarse crepitations heard during the chest exam, along with the elevated heart rate, suggest a possible bacterial infection. The CBC also shows leukopenia with a neutrophil count of 0.6, indicating an impaired immune system. Therefore, prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary to prevent further complications. Other management options such as b. broad spectrum antibiotics po or e. reassure and send home would not be appropriate as the patient has a significant risk of developing a severe infection. c. gcsf is used for chemotherapy-induced leucopenia, but it would not be sufficient to treat a bacterial infection. d. postponing the treatment until bacteriology results are available is not recommended because it may lead to a delay in treatment and unfavorable outcomes.

While the patient has delivered a big baby, the fact that her uterus is well contracted suggests that it is not an atonic uterus (option a). Retained products of conception (option c) and a large placental site (option d) could potentially contribute to PPH, but they are less likely given the information provided. Ruptured uterus (option e) is also less likely based on the patient's well-contracted uterus.

This is because the patient is showing symptoms of meningitis, a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Option B, isolate the patient, may be necessary later on but is not the immediate priority. Option C, gown and mask, may be necessary for healthcare workers but is not urgent for the patient's treatment.

Febrile convulsions are common in children aged between 6 months and 5 years and typically occur with a fever, particularly in association with viral or bacterial infections. The recurrence of seizures in this case also supports the possibility of febrile convulsions, as they often recur during the same illness. Absence seizures (b) and partial complex seizures (d) usually present differently and are less common in children of this age. While epilepsy (c) can be a possibility, a single febrile seizure does not qualify for an epilepsy diagnosis. It is important to manage the fever and monitor the child for further seizures, while also investigating the underlying cause of the fever.",a,a,TRUE,

Although mefloquine is an effective drug for treating malaria, it cannot eradicate the hepatic cycle of the parasite, which is necessary for complete elimination of the infection. Similarly, doxycycline and proguanil are commonly used for prophylaxis of malaria, but they are not the preferred drugs for treating an active infection. Artesonate is a potent antimalarial drug, but it is mostly used for severe, complicated cases of malaria. Therefore, quinine is the most appropriate drug for eradicating the infection indicated by the patient's symptoms and blood film findings.",d,d,TRUE,

Chest physiotherapy is a treatment that helps to mobilize and remove secretions that may be present in the lungs after surgery. This is important because after surgery, patients are at an increased risk of developing atelectasis, which can lead to reduced air entry and increase the risk of infection. Option A, cefuroxime, and option B, ceftriaxone, are antibiotics and would not necessarily help with atelectasis or reduced air entry. Option C, chlorpheniramine, is an antihistamine and would not be appropriate for this patient. Option E, reassure, would not address the patient's symptoms or help improve their condition.",d,d,TRUE,

[external laryngeal nerve functions to tense the vocal cords by activating the cricothyroid muscle, increasing pitch].","The correct answer is d. external laryngeal nerve injury. The external laryngeal nerve functions to tense the vocal cords by activating the cricothyroid muscle, increasing pitch. Inability to raise the pitch of her voice is a characteristic symptom of an external laryngeal nerve injury. Choice a, thyroid storm, is incorrect as this is a life-threatening condition causing fever, tachycardia, and hyperthyroidism. Choices b and c, bilateral and unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, respectively, are unlikely as these would cause problems with both the pitch and volume of the voice. Choice e, thyroid cyst, is also unlikely as this wouldn't affect the function of the nerves responsible for voice pitch.",d,d,TRUE,

Uterine rupture is suggested by the presence of features of shock, exquisitely tender lower abdomen with abdominal pain, and a CTG that is now becoming non-reassuring, with reduced variability and late deceleration that develops with slow recovery. Furthermore, the woman has had a previous history of LSCS for a breech baby, which increases the risk of uterine rupture. Endometritis and UTI are more likely to cause fever and show differently on examination, while urinary tract injury and pleurisy are less likely to present with abdominal pain and a non-reassuring CTG.",e,e,TRUE,

Down Syndrome is the most likely diagnosis as it is commonly associated with features such as failure to thrive, constipation, macroglossia (large tongue), and a history of prolonged neonatal jaundice. Fragile X Syndrome is not typically associated with these features and is usually characterized by developmental delays and cognitive impairment. Prader-Willi Syndrome is typically associated with hyperphagia (overeating), short stature, and hypogonadism. DiGeorge Syndrome is typically associated with heart defects and immune system abnormalities. Congenital hypothyroidism may also present with failure to thrive and constipation, but typically does not present with a large tongue or a history of prolonged neonatal jaundice.",a,a,TRUE,

[in newborn can be recognized by convulsions from hypocalcaemia due to malfunctioning parathyroid glands and low level of parathyroid hormones].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 3-month-old infant with recurrent infections, abnormal facies, and absent thymic shadow on CXR is Digeorge syndrome. This is supported by early age of onset, absent thymic shadow on CXR, and a history of recurrent infection, which is common in children with immune system problems due to an absent or hypoplastic thymus. Newborns may also present with convulsions due to hypocalcemia from malfunctioning parathyroid glands and low levels of parathyroid hormones. Downs syndrome and Fragile X syndrome have different clinical features and do not typically present with these findings. Marfans syndrome is not associated with abnormal facies or absent thymic shadow on CXR, making it an unlikely diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,

[for tetanus vaccine and management uk protocol is a bit different from other countries].,"The correct answer for this question is option A, human Ig only. The reason for this is because tetanus is caused by a bacterial infection that invades the nervous system and produces potent toxins that cause muscle stiffness and spasms. Although the man says he received tetanus toxoid (tt) when he left school, it is not known whether his immunity levels are still sufficient to protect him from the bacteria that cause tetanus. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, he should be given human Ig, which offers immediate passive immunity against the bacteria. The other options are incorrect because they do not offer immediate protection against the bacteria. Full course of tetanus vaccine only (option C) takes time to develop immunity, while option B, human Ig and tt, is not necessary because the man has already received tt in the past. Option D, human Ig and full course of tetanus vaccine, may be indicated if the man has low or unknown immunity levels against tetanus. Finally, option E, antibiotic nan nan nan nan nan, is not a valid option for preventing tetanus but may be necessary in case of secondary bacterial infection resulting from the knife wound.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the patient is presenting with the triad of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia, which is a classic presentation of Lofgren's syndrome. The other options listed are less likely to be seen in this scenario. Apical granuloma is more commonly associated with tuberculosis. Lobar consolidation and pleural effusion may suggest pneumonia or other lung infections, but are not typically associated with erythema nodosum or arthralgia. Reticular shadowing in the bases may suggest a chronic lung disease like interstitial lung disease, but this is not consistent with the acute onset of symptoms described in the scenario. Therefore, the most likely CXR appearance would be bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy due to the presentation of Lofgren's syndrome.",b,b,TRUE,

The double bubble sign on a CXR indicates duodenal atresia, a condition where the first portion of the small intestine is not fully developed. Low set ears and a flat occiput are physical characteristics commonly seen in individuals with Down's Syndrome. Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic condition that results in intellectual disability, but it does not present with the physical characteristics described in the question stem. Turner's Syndrome and DiGeorge Syndrome are also genetic conditions, but neither of them typically present with duodenal atresia or the physical characteristics described. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the neonate in this scenario is Down's Syndrome.",a,a,TRUE,

Antihistamines are the first-line treatment for relieving itching caused by insect bites. Penicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin are antibiotics that are used to treat bacterial infections and are not effective for reducing itching caused by insect bites. Reassurance alone is not sufficient for relieving symptoms of itching. Therefore, oral antihistamines are the most appropriate treatment for this patient to provide relief from itching caused by the insect bite.",c,c,TRUE,
"188. a man presents with scrotal swelling, the swelling is cystic and is non-tender. it is located in the upper pole of the posterior part of the testis. what is the most likely dx?",a. epididymal cyst,b. testicular ca,c. hydrocele,d. teratoma,e. testicular torsion,,,,,,key: the key is a. epididymal cyst. [the location of upper pole of the posterior part of testis is the common site for epididymal pathology].,"The most likely diagnosis for a non-tender cystic swelling in the upper pole of the posterior part of the testis is an epididymal cyst. This is because the location is a common site for epididymal pathology. Testicular cancer, hydrocele, teratoma, and testicular torsion can present with scrotal swelling but they usually have distinctive features that differentiate them from an epididymal cyst. Testicular cancer is usually hard and nodular, while hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac that surrounds the testis. Teratoma is a type of tumor that consists of multiple types of tissues, and testicular torsion is a medical emergency that results in severe, sudden pain. Therefore, based on the location, presentation, and characteristics of the swelling, an epididymal cyst is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

[normal vital signs, sweating and collapse during exercise gives suspicion of hypoglycemia which is very easy to treat but fatal if left unrecognized. so most important next step is to check the blood sugar].","In this scenario, the most important next step is to check the young footballer's blood sugar (option C). This is because the presence of normal vital signs alongside sweating and confusion could indicate hypoglycemia, which is easy to treat but can be fatal if left unrecognized. Checking the blood sugar can confirm or rule out this possibility and allow for timely intervention. Options A (CT) and B (MRI) are both diagnostic imaging tests that are not necessary at this point. Option D (body temp) is also not a priority as the patient's vital signs indicate that they are not in immediate danger of hyperthermia. Option E (IV fluids) may be beneficial but is not the most important next step. Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it addresses the most pressing concern and can potentially prevent further complications.",c,c,TRUE,
190. a 45yo waitress complains of pelvic pain which worsens pre-menstrually and on standing and walking. she also complains of post-coital ache. select the most likely cause leading to her symptoms?,a. pid,b. endometritiosis,c. pelvic congestion syndrome,d. adenomyosis,e. premature ovarian failure,,,,,,"key: the key is c. pelvic congestion syndrome. [women with pelvic congestion syndrome experience a constant pain that may be dull and aching, but is occasionally more acute. the pain is worse at the end of the day and after long periods of standing, and sufferers get relief when they lie down. the pain is worse during or after sexual intercourse, and can be worse just before the onset of the menstrual period. cause is attributed to female hormone estrogen induced vascular (venous) changes. so it is usually seen in females].","The correct answer is c, pelvic congestion syndrome. This is supported by the woman's symptoms of constant pelvic pain that worsens on standing and walking, worsens pre-menstrually, and post-coital ache. Additionally, the relief she feels when lying down is consistent with pelvic congestion syndrome. The cause of this syndrome is attributed to estrogen-induced vascular changes, which is why it is usually seen in females. The other choices are unlikely as they do not fit the woman's symptoms. PID (a) typically causes fever and vaginal discharge, whereas endometriosis (b) can lead to severe menstrual pain and fertility issues. Adenomyosis (d) causes heavy, painful periods and premature ovarian failure (e) results in menopause-like symptoms in women under 40. Therefore, the correct choice for her symptoms is c.",c,c,TRUE,

[median nerve is the nerve injured in colle’s fracture].,"The correct answer to the question is D) median nerve. When a patient presents with a dinner fork deformity after a fall on an outstretched hand, the most likely injury is a Colles fracture, which is a fracture of the distal radius. The median nerve runs through the wrist and carpal tunnel, and is therefore at risk of injury in this setting. The axillary nerve, radial nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, and ulnar nerve are not commonly associated with Colles fractures. Therefore, the median nerve is the single most associated nerve injury in this scenario.",d,d,TRUE,

This answer is concerning because at 15 months, children should have a larger vocabulary and be able to communicate more effectively. This suggests that there may be a delay in the child's language development, which could potentially affect their overall development. The other choices are not as concerning as they are relatively common at this age. Shyness towards strangers is a typical behavior for young children as they are still developing their social skills. Walking but not running is also common as children are still learning how to coordinate their movements. The inability to make a sentence is also not necessarily alarming as this can vary between children and their language development milestones. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it is the only choice that suggests a potential developmental delay.",c,c,TRUE,

PID or pelvic inflammatory disease. This is because using an IUCD is a risk factor for developing PID, which can cause pelvic pain and heavy painful periods. Endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, and Asherman syndrome can also cause similar symptoms, but they are less likely in this case based on the given information. For example, fibroids typically cause painless menorrhagia, while Asherman syndrome is characterized by diminished menstrual flow due to intrauterine scarring. Therefore, PID is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's IUCD use and symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[diagnostic cell in hodgkins disease is reed-sternberg cells].,"The correct answer to this question is b. R-S cells. Hodgkin's disease is diagnosed through the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in lymph node biopsies. Reed-Sternberg cells are abnormal cells that arise from B cells, but have lost the B cell markers while at the same time gaining the expression of markers normally found on T cells. This is why options a, c, and d (T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages, respectively) are incorrect choices. Option e (Auer rods) is also incorrect as Auer rods are found in acute myeloid leukemia, not in Hodgkin's disease. Therefore, answer choice b remains the correct answer due to the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in cases of Hodgkin's disease.",b,b,TRUE,

Her paracetamol levels are just below the level that would require treatment. While her drug levels are safe for now, the combination of drug overdose and alcohol consumption requires psychiatric evaluation, making option a the correct choice. Option b, referring the patient to a medical ward, would not be appropriate since the patient requires psychiatric evaluation. Option c, administering N-acetylcysteine, is typically used to treat patients with high levels of paracetamol and is not necessary in this case because the levels are below the treatment threshold. Option d, checking the serum plasma paracetamol, has already been done and the levels are just below the treatment threshold. Lastly, option e, no further investigation, is not recommended given the patient's history of drug overdose and alcohol consumption, which requires psychiatric evaluation.",a,a,TRUE,

TVUS is preferred in this case because the patient has been on HRT and endometrial thickness needs to be evaluated. If endometrial thickness is greater than 5mm, there is a risk of endometrial cancer. Cervical smear and high vaginal swab are not suitable for this case as they are more useful for evaluating cervical pathology or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), respectively. TFT is also not a suitable investigation for this case as it is used to evaluate thyroid function. Therefore, TVUS is the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient.",d,d,TRUE,

[aspirin can cause reye's syndrome in children, so should not be given. if paracetamol or ibuprofen fail only then triptan should be given].","The correct answer to this question is A. Paracetamol. This is because the young girl is experiencing episodic headaches that last between 2-3 days, which could be a sign of a migraine. Paracetamol is the first-line treatment for migraines and can effectively alleviate the pain. Aspirin should be avoided as it can cause a severe condition known as Reye's syndrome in children. Sumatriptan and Cafergot are both migraine-specific treatments and should only be used if paracetamol fails to alleviate the pain. Gabapentin is not a recommended treatment for migraines. Overall, paracetamol is the safest and most effective option for treating this young girl's episodic headaches.",a,a,TRUE,

The symptoms of cyanosis, hypotension, tense neck, and blood oozing from the drain all point towards this type of hemorrhage, which occurs within the first 24 hours after surgery. Thyroid storm (A) and tracheomalacia (E) do not present with the same symptoms, and secondary hemorrhage (C) and primary hemorrhage (D) typically occur later in the recovery process. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is reactionary hemorrhage.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient is 33 years old, which is a younger age that is commonly seen in cases of extradural hemorrhage. Also, the patient experienced considerable head trauma, which is a risk factor for this type of hemorrhage. Moreover, the presence of a lucid interval - a period of normalcy following the injury before the worsening of symptoms - is a feature seen in both subdural and extradural hemorrhage. However, the sudden decline in consciousness after a previously normal period points more towards extradural hemorrhage as the cause. SAH, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subdural hemorrhage are less likely due to inconsistency with the given information.",d,d,TRUE,

[age (usually occurs in 60s or 70s), loss of bladder control (enuresis), waddling gait and behavior change are all features of normal pressure hydrocephalus].","The most likely diagnosis based on the given information is c. normal pressure hydrocephalus. This is because the patient fits the classic triad of symptoms associated with this condition, which includes urinary incontinence, gait disturbance (waddling gait), and cognitive impairment. Additionally, the patient's age of 77 years is within the usual range for the onset of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Subdural hemorrhage and brain tumor are less likely as they would typically present with symptoms such as headaches or neurological deficits in addition to the symptoms observed in this patient. Psychotic depression does not fit with the specific symptoms described and is therefore an unlikely diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,

CBT, or cognitive-behavioral therapy, is the treatment of choice for PTSD. CBT helps to reduce anxiety and PTSD symptoms by helping the patient identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs that may be contributing to their symptoms. It also helps the patient learn coping skills to manage their symptoms and gradually face and overcome the situations that they are avoiding. Diazepam, citalopram, dosulepin, and olanzapine are not appropriate management options for PTSD as these medications do not specifically target the symptoms of PTSD and may have negative side effects. It is important to note that medication may be used in conjunction with therapy, but medication alone is not the recommended first-line treatment for PTSD.",a,a,TRUE,

The presented case shows a very low white blood cell count (WBC), low red blood cell count (RBC), and low platelet count (PLT) which are typical findings in leukemia. Moreover, the presence of both splenomegaly and orchidomegaly is highly suggestive of leukemia. The option b, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), usually affects adults and presents with slowly progressive symptoms. The options c, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and d, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), usually present with higher WBC counts and are more common in adults than children.

[why not duodenal atresia? pyloric stenosis is much more commoner than duodenal atresia; in duodenal atresia the vomitus should contain bile, which is not the case in pyloric stenosis].","The correct answer is a. pyloric stenosis. This is because the presentation of the 6-week-old child with vomiting, constipation, and decreased serum potassium levels is typical of pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis is a common condition in infants characterized by the narrowing of the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. This narrowing can cause vomiting, constipation, and dehydration. Duodenal atresia is less common than pyloric stenosis and in this condition, the vomit should contain bile, which is not present in the case of pyloric stenosis. Hirschsprung disease, achalasia cardia, and tracheo-esophageal fistula are also unlikely as they do not commonly present with vomiting and constipation in infants.

[seizers associated with contraction of specific muscle group is seen in myoclonic seizers].,"The correct answer is C, myoclonic, because the symptoms described indicate a seizure associated with the contraction of a specific muscle group, which is characteristic of myoclonic seizures. Grand mal seizures involve loss of consciousness and convulsions, while tonic clonic seizures are characterized by stiffening of the body and jerking movements. Absent seizures involve brief periods of staring and may involve subtle body movements, but typically do not exhibit the type of muscle contractions described. Therefore, the symptoms described in this case are most consistent with a myoclonic seizure.",c,c,TRUE,

[renal impairment is delayed by acei].,"The correct answer is A. ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can delay the progression of chronic GN (glomerulonephritis) and renal impairment by reducing the pressure in the kidneys which can cause further damage to the kidney tissues. Diuretics may be used to manage hypertension, but they do not have a direct effect on preventing the progression of chronic GN. Cytotoxic medications and long-term antibiotics are not indicated in the management of chronic GN. Steroids may be used in some cases but are not the first-line treatment for preventing the progression of chronic GN. Therefore, the best medication option for preventing the progression of chronic GN in this patient is ACE inhibitors.",a,a,TRUE,

[hyperventilation causes co2 washout and respiratory alkalosis.  an increase in ph, alkalosis, promotes increased protein binding, which decreases free calcium levels and this low calcium causes perioral persthesia and carpopedal spasm. if you continue breathing and rebreathing in paper bag it will allow co2 concentration to rise in paper bag and as you rebreath this again and again you will regain some washed out co2 and thus relief to this alkalosis]. key: 2. the girl may have anxiety disorder when it precipitates leads to hyperventilation syndrome. x","The next step for this patient is to perform rebreathing into a paper bag (option C). The presentation of perioral paresthesia and carpopedal spasm is suggestive of respiratory alkalosis caused by hyperventilation. Rebreathing into a paper bag will allow CO2 concentration to rise in the bag, which will be rebreathed again and again, leading to relief from the alkalosis. Options A (SSRI), B (diazepam), D (propranolol), and E (alprazolam) are not appropriate for this patient because they are typically used for anxiety or panic disorders, which are not definitively diagnosed in this case.",c,c,TRUE,

Additionally, the patient has been relying on alcohol to alleviate these symptoms, indicating that she may be experiencing a panic attack. The other choices such as depression, OCD, and alcohol addiction do not fit the patient's symptoms as well as panic disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may also be a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the presence of palpitations and tremors, which are not common with GAD. Therefore, panic disorder is the most suitable diagnosis in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,
208. a 2yo child is very naughty. his teacher complains that he is easily distracted. his parents say that he can’t do a particular task for a long time. he sometimes hurts himself and breaks many things. this causes many troubles at home. what is the dx?,a. asd,b. dyslexia,c. adhd,d. antisocial personality disorder,e. oppositional defiant,,,,,,key: the key is c. adhd (attention deficit hyperreactive disorder).,"Based on the symptoms described, the correct diagnosis is ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), option C. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects children and adults and is characterized by symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. The child's behavior of being easily distracted, being unable to focus on a task for long, hurting himself, and breaking things are all classic symptoms of ADHD. Other options such as ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and dyslexia do not match the symptoms described. ASD is typically characterized by social difficulties, communication challenges, and repetitive behaviors, while dyslexia specifically affects reading and writing skills. Antisocial Personality Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder are both personality disorders that involve disruptive behavior patterns, but they are not present in a 2-year-old child. Therefore, based on the symptoms described, the correct diagnosis is ADHD.",c,c,TRUE,

Crohn's disease (CD), as fecal leakage in the urinary bag is a common feature of CD and can lead to the formation of a fistula connecting the colon or small intestine to the bladder. It is important to note that CD can occur at any age, including in a 79-year-old individual. Diuretics and rectosigmoid tumors are unlikely to cause fecal leakage into the urinary tract. Large bowel perforation may cause fecal peritonitis but would not result in fecal leakage into the urinary tract. Ulcerative colitis (UC) may cause inflammation and ulcers in the colon, but it does not typically cause fistulas to form. Therefore, the correct answer is b. CD, and the other options are not relevant to this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,

[electrolyte imbalance should be checked in this baby presenting with diarrhea and vomiting for considerable time].,"The appropriate initial investigation for a 2-month-old baby presenting with diarrhea and vomiting for 6 days and lethargy is option A, a Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) or electrolyte panel. This is because electrolyte imbalances, specifically sodium and potassium, can occur as a result of prolonged diarrhea and vomiting. These imbalances can lead to lethargy, dehydration, and even seizures in severe cases. Option B, random blood sugar, is not the appropriate initial investigation as there are no specific indications of hypoglycemia in the case description. Options C, D, and E, CBC, CXR, and AXR respectively, are not necessary as there are no indications of systemic infection or respiratory or abdominal issues. It is important to treat any detected electrolyte imbalances appropriately and start managing the underlying cause of the diarrhea and vomiting as well.",a,a,TRUE,

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities and memory loss. The slow speech and difficulty in providing answers are indicative of the cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease. Options B, C, D, and E are less probable as they do not typically present with the symptoms described. Vascular dementia (option B) is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the brain, which can result in sudden changes in behavior and difficulty with walking, but it typically presents with other symptoms like confusion and disorientation. TIAs (option C) are mini-strokes that can cause temporary, short-lived symptoms, but they are not typically associated with cognitive impairment. Pseudo-dementia (option D) is a reversible condition that presents with depression and cognitive symptoms, not just slow speech and delayed responses. Picks dementia (option E) is a rare form of dementia that is typically associated with changes in personality and behavior rather than slow speech and delayed responses. Therefore, option A, Alzheimer's disease, is the most probable diagnosis for the elderly man in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

In pelvic fractures, there is a higher risk of urethral rupture, which can displace the urethral catheter during placement. Therefore, a suprapubic catheter is a better option for managing a patient with pelvic fracture who is unable to pass urine. IV fluids (c) are important for maintaining adequate hydration, but they do not address the urinary retention issue directly. IV furosemide (d) is a diuretic used to treat edema and not indicated in this case. Insulin (e) is not relevant to the management of this patient. Therefore, the correct management for this patient would be to place a suprapubic catheter to relieve urinary retention caused by the pelvic fracture.",b,b,TRUE,

Reassurance (option b) alone is not appropriate as the patient is symptomatic. Ursodeoxycholic acid (option d) may be less effective for a big stone and a low-fat diet (option c) may help prevent gallstone formation but is not appropriate for treating a big stone causing symptoms. Emergency laparotomy (option e) is not indicated in this non-emergent situation where a laparoscopic approach is more preferred due to its minimally invasive nature. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be a. lap cholecystectomy.",a,a,TRUE,
"214. in a man who is neglected and alcohol dependent, whith high suicidal risk, which factor can increase this risk further?",a. alcohol dependence,b. ssri,c. s]moking,d. agoraphobia,e. court involvement,,,,,,key: the key is a. alcohol dependence. this is wrong key!! correct key should be b. ssri. [he is already alcohol dependent. so further (additional) risk factor is ssri (ssri has well known risk of developing suicidal ideation]. arrest and court involvement is also a risk factor and in a neglected person it is also a strong risk factor.,"The correct answer for this question is b. SSRI. While alcohol dependence is a risk factor on its own, the addition of SSRIs elevate the risk of developing suicidal ideation considerably. Smoking and agoraphobia may contribute to his overall health concerns but do not directly increase suicidal risk. Court involvement can add to the stress and anxiety levels but does not necessarily increase suicidal ideation. Therefore, in the context of a neglectful and alcohol-dependent man with high suicidal risk, the primary factor that can further escalate the risk of suicide is the use of SSRI medication. It is crucial to closely monitor the individual for any adverse reactions or changes in mood when taking SSRIs or any other medications.",b,b,TRUE,
215. a 71 yo man presents with coarse tremor. he is on some meds. which one can be the reason for the tremor?,a. lithium,b. diazepam,c. fluoxetine,d. imipramine,e. haloperidol,,,,,,key: the key is a. lithium. actually in therapeutic dose lithium causes fine tremor but in toxic dose it causes coarse tremor. so the probable answer is lithium.,"The correct answer to the question is option A, lithium. In therapeutic doses, lithium can cause a fine tremor, but in toxic doses, it can cause a coarse tremor, which could be the reason for the patient's symptoms. Diazepam, fluoxetine, imipramine, and haloperidol are not known to cause a coarse tremor as a side effect. Therefore, they are not likely to be the reason for the patient's symptoms. It is important to note that the patient's medical history and current medication regimen should be carefully evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the exact cause of the tremor.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because UC is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon, causing inflammation, ulcers, and decreased mucus production. The presence of goblet cell depletion on rectal biopsy supports the diagnosis of UC as opposed to Crohn's disease (CD), which can also cause mouth ulcers but typically presents with goblet cell hyperplasia and increased mucus secretion. Bowel cancer and obstruction are less likely causes given the patient's age and symptoms, and IBS may cause similar symptoms but does not typically result in goblet cell depletion. Therefore, UC is the most probable diagnosis in this case.",b,b,TRUE,
"217. after eating a cookie at a garden party, a child began to cough and went blue. the mother also noticed that there were swollen patches on the skin. what is the dx?",a. allergic reaction,b. aspiration of food,c. cyanotic heart disease,d. trachea-esophageal fistula,e. achalasia cardia,,,,,,key: the key is a. allergic reaction.,"The correct answer is a. allergic reaction. This could be caused by the child having an allergy to an ingredient in the cookie, such as nuts or dairy. The cough and blue color are indicative of an anaphylactic reaction, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The swollen patches on the skin are also a common symptom of an allergic reaction. Aspiration of food, cyanotic heart disease, trachea-esophageal fistula, and achalasia cardia are unlikely to cause all of the symptoms described in the scenario, making them incorrect choices. Aspiration of food would primarily result in difficulty breathing or choking, while cyanotic heart disease would cause the child to appear blue due to poor circulation. Trachea-esophageal fistula and achalasia cardia are also unlikely causes as they are both uncommon conditions that would not be expected to occur without other symptoms or risk factors.",a,a,TRUE,

[balance difficulties, vomiting and nausea suggests cerebellar lesion. in posterior fossa lesion mri is preferred].","The best diagnostic investigation for a 70-year-old man presenting with balance difficulties, vomiting, and nausea would be a MRI of the cerebellum. These symptoms suggest a cerebellar lesion, which is best visualized with MRI as compared to CT or skull xr. LP and blood cultures are not indicated for this particular presentation. Therefore, option A is the best choice for diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,
219. a 2 yo pt presents with colicky pain which radiates from loin to groin. he complains of similar episodes in the past. inv has been done and 7mm stone was found in the ureter. what is the most appropriate management?,a. percutaneous nephrolithotomy,b. open surgery,c. ureteroscopy or laser,d. conservative tx,e. eswl,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is e. eswl.

This minimally invasive treatment has become the primary mode of treatment for pediatric patients with reno-ureteral stones, given its safety profile. Stones less than 5mm usually pass spontaneously, while those 5-10mm, or those causing unresolved pain, may require medical expulsive therapy with Nifedipine or Tamsulosin and/or Prednisolone. Ureteroscopy using Dormia basket is recommended for stones between 10mm to 2cm, while stones bigger than 2cm, large, multiple or complex cases require Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy. Open surgery is usually not considered in such cases due to its invasiveness and associated complications. Therefore, ESWL is the most appropriate management for a 2-year-old patient with a 7mm stone in the ureter due to its minimally invasive approach, which is safe and effective for this population.",e,e,TRUE,

[to exclude torsion].,"The correct next step in the management of a footballer presenting with severe pain and mild swelling in the scrotum after being struck by a kick is exploratory surgery (key: c). This is important to exclude torsion, which is characterized by sudden and severe scrotal pain and swelling due to twisting of the testicle on its vascular pedicle, potentially leading to testicular necrosis and infertility. USG and Doppler can be useful complementary diagnostic tools, but are inferior to exploratory surgery in this clinical scenario, as they may not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to confidently exclude the diagnosis of torsion. IV fluids and antibiotics may be appropriate adjunctive measures, but they do not address the underlying diagnosis and should not delay definitive management.",c,c,TRUE,

[repeated flashbacks and tendency to avoid the thoughts of stressor is diagnostic of ptsd].,"The correct answer is b. PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) because the person is an ex-soldier and is experiencing flashbacks and avoidance of certain triggers related to their past trauma. While depression and anxiety can be common symptoms of PTSD, they do not fully encompass the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear and anxiety, but do not necessarily involve recurring memories of past trauma. Agoraphobia is a fear of open or public places and does not necessarily involve flashbacks or traumatic memories. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and persistent worry about a variety of everyday issues, and does not involve past traumatic events. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is b. PTSD.",b,b,TRUE,

[initial depressive episode (may be befor a long) followed by mania is bipolar affective disorder].,"The correct answer is c) bipolar affective disorder. This is because the woman in the scenario is exhibiting symptoms of both mania (spending a lot of money, going out almost every night, overconfidence) and depression (having a low mood at 12 years old), indicating a cyclical pattern of highs and lows in her mood. Borderline personality disorder (d) is characterized by unstable relationships and emotions, but does not typically involve distinct episodes of mania and depression. Dysthymia (e) is a chronic, low-grade depression that does not involve manic episodes. Overall, bipolar affective disorder is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
223. a 28 yo female presents with a 3m hx of diarrhea. she complains of abdominal discomfort and passing stool 20x/day. exam=febrile. barium enema shows cobblestone mucosa. what is the most likely dx?,a. ameoba,b. colon ca,c. ge,d. cd,e. uc,,,,,,"key: the key is d. cd.

Ameoba and colon cancer are unlikely as they typically present with different symptoms such as blood in stool or weight loss. Gastroenteritis (GE) and ulcerative colitis (UC) may also present with diarrhea and abdominal discomfort, but the cobblestone appearance on the barium enema is characteristic of CD. Therefore, the correct answer is d. CD.",d,d,TRUE,

[high fever, bark-like cough in a child suggest croup which is treated with corticosteroids. drooling is sign ofepigottitis which may be a bad recall here].","In the case presented, the key to the answer is incorrect. Epiglottitis is usually accompanied by drooling, but in this scenario, a bark-like cough is present, which is more characteristic of croup. Therefore, the correct key should be a. corticosteroids. High fever and a bark-like cough in a child suggest the diagnosis of croup, which is treated with corticosteroids. It is important to note that drooling is a sign of epiglottitis and is not present in this case, so it is essential to differentiate between the two conditions. Paracetamol, adrenaline nebulizer, IV antibiotics, and intubation under GA are not appropriate treatments for croup. In this scenario, the most appropriate treatment for the child would be corticosteroids.",a,a,TRUE,

[age 78 yrs, living in a care home where unnoticed trivial injury is possible (like fall), warfarine and high inr is potential risk factor of subdural haemorrhage suggested by bruises on arms also].","The most probable diagnosis for the 78-year-old lady on warfarin for atrial fibrillation who presents with progressive confusion for three days and bruises on her arms with an INR of 7 is subdural hemorrhage, which is indicated by the risk factor of warfarin use and high INR. Alzheimer's, delirium, vascular dementia, and Pick's dementia are all incorrect choices because they do not match the symptoms presented. Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain disease that causes memory loss, but does not involve bruising or INR levels. Delirium is a sudden and severe confusion typically caused by an underlying condition or medication, but does not involve INR levels or bruises. Vascular dementia is a type of dementia caused by damaged blood vessels in the brain, but can present with symptoms such as strokes or mini-strokes and does not involve INR levels or bruises. Pick's dementia is a rare form of dementia that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, but presents with personality and behavior changes, and does not involve INR levels or bruises. Therefore, subdural hemorrhage is the correct diagnosis due to the risk factors and symptoms present in the case study.",c,c,TRUE,

[iv calcium gluconate is given to protect the heart from lethal arrhythmia or cardiac arrest from high potassium level and used to buy time while definitive management is being taken. actually calcium gluconate don’t lower the potassium level that much but protect the heart from arrhythmia].,"The correct answer is b. IV calcium gluconate. The patient presenting with collapse and anuria along with high levels of serum potassium and early pulmonary edema suggests that the patient may be experiencing severe acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances. The high potassium level puts the patient at risk of lethal arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, which is where the IV calcium gluconate comes in. It acts to protect the heart from arrhythmias while the definitive management is being taken to lower potassium levels. IV insulin + dextrose and furosemide could be used to lower potassium levels, but both carry a risk of causing hypokalemia. Urgent hemodialysis would be appropriate for severe hyperkalemia, but it may not be initially feasible as it takes time to set up. IV NS 0.9% can provide hydration, but it won't address the primary concern of hyperkalemia. Therefore, IV calcium gluconate is the most appropriate initial management in this situation to prevent lethal cardiac complications.",b,b,TRUE,

CT brain. Based on the patient's presenting symptoms of severe headache with vomiting and loss of consciousness, as well as the absence of neurological deficits, a basilar migraine is a potential diagnosis. However, in order to rule out other possible causes such as a bleed or brain injury, neuroimaging is necessary. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria for basilar migraine require at least two previous migraine attacks with aura, which may not have been reported by the patient. Therefore, admission for observation or reassurance and discharge without any further testing would not be appropriate. MRI head could also be a consideration, but CT brain is a more widely available and quicker option. The other choices are not relevant to the situation.",b,b,TRUE,

[ borderline personality disorder: act impulsively and develop intense but short-lived emotional attachment to others. they are usually attention seekers but not suicidal].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 25-year-old woman in the scenario is (d) borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is a mental health condition that is characterized by impulsiveness, intense but fleeting emotional attachments, and attention-seeking behaviors. This woman's distress and constant fear of her boyfriend ending their relationship indicate a fear of abandonment, which is a common trait among individuals with borderline personality disorder. Furthermore, her superficial lacerations on her forearm suggest that she may be engaging in self-harm as a coping mechanism. The other answer choices, such as acute psychosis, severe depression, psychotic depression, and schizophrenia, do not fit the woman's symptoms as closely as borderline personality disorder. Therefore, (d) borderline personality disorder is the correct answer for the most likely diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,

LSD. The young woman's symptoms of low temperature and tremors, combined with her visual hallucinations of seeing colors when her eyes are closed, are consistent with LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) use. LSD is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that can cause alterations in perception, thought, and mood. Amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy may cause similar symptoms such as tremors and hallucinations, but they are not typically associated with low body temperature and visual hallucinations the way that LSD is. Heroin, on the other hand, is a depressant drug that would not cause symptoms like tremors or visual hallucinations.",b,b,TRUE,
230. a lady comes in severe liver disease and hematemesis. her inr is >10. what should she be given?,a. ffp,b. steroids,c. whole blood,d. iv fluids,e. vit k,,,,,,key: the key is a. ffp.,"The correct answer is a) FFP or fresh frozen plasma. This is because the patient is experiencing severe liver disease and hematemesis which indicates a problem with blood clotting. The INR level above 10 further confirms this issue. FFP contains important clotting factors which can help stop the bleeding and improve the clotting function of the patient's blood. Steroids and IV fluids do not address the underlying issue of blood clotting and are not appropriate for this patient. Whole blood may not be necessary as the patient may only require the specific clotting factors found in FFP. Vitamin K may also be given in addition to FFP, but it is not the primary treatment for this patient's condition. Therefore, the correct answer is a) FFP.",a,a,TRUE,
"231. after eating a cookie at a garden party, a child began to cough and went blue. the mother also noticed that there were swollen patches on the skin. what is the initial management?",a. otc antihistamine,b. oxygen,c. bronchodilators,d. epinephrine im,e. nebulized epinephrine,,,,,,key: the key is d. epinephrine im [anaphylaxis with partially blocked airway].,"The correct answer for the initial management of a child who experienced coughing, skin swelling, and turning blue after eating a cookie at a garden party is d. epinephrine im. This is because these symptoms indicate an anaphylactic reaction, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis as it helps to relax the muscles in the airways and raise blood pressure. OTC antihistamines may not be effective in managing anaphylaxis, and bronchodilators are not typically used as a first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Oxygen may provide respiratory support but does not treat the underlying cause of the anaphylaxis. Nebulized epinephrine is not the recommended initial management for anaphylaxis with a partially blocked airway. Therefore, the correct answer is d. epinephrine im, which can help control the allergic reaction and stabilize the child's condition.",d,d,TRUE,
232. a 63 yo female is noted to have left pupil irresponsive to light and is dilated. what is the most .probably dx?,a. pontine hemorrhage,b. subdural hemorrhage,c. cerebellar hemorrhage,d. extradural hemorrhage,e. subarachnoid hemorrhage,,,,,,key: the key is d. extradural hemorrhage. this is a wrong key! correct key is b. subdural hemorrhage.,"The correct answer to this question is b. subdural hemorrhage. This is because the patient exhibits symptoms such as left pupil irresponsiveness to light and dilation, which are indicative of a subdural hemorrhage. A subdural hemorrhage is the accumulation of blood between the dura mater and arachnoid mater, which can lead to increased pressure on the brain and result in neurological symptoms such as the ones observed in the patient. The other choices, such as pontine, cerebellar, extradural, and subarachnoid hemorrhages, do not match the symptoms observed in the patient and are therefore incorrect answers. It is important to correctly identify the type of hemorrhage in such cases as prompt treatment can help save the patient's life and prevent further damage.",b,b,TRUE,
"233. a 28yo business executive  presents at the gp asking for some help because she has been arguing with her boyfriend frequently. she is worried about her weight, and she thinks she may be fat. she has been on a diet and lost 7 kgs in the last 2 months on purpose. she is eating less. she used to do a lot of exercise. now she says she’s feeling down, has some insomnia and feels tired and without energy. she has not showed up at work. she is worried because recently she got a loan to buy a luxury car. she can’t be fired. she complains about her low mood. she thinks this is weird because she used to be extremely productive. she used to work showing an excellent performance at the office. she even received compliments from her boss. how, she says her boyfriend is angry because her apartment is a chaos. usually she spends a lot of time cleaning it, even upto 3 am. she liked it to be perfect, but not it’s a mess. on exam: bmi=23, no other signs. what is the most probably dx?",a. anorexia nervosa,b. bipolar disease,c. binge eating disorder,d. hyperthyroidism,e. schizophrenia,,,,,,key: the key is b. bipolar disorder.  [now she is depressed but before hypomanic which makes the likely dx of bipolar disorder].,"The most probable diagnosis for the 28-year-old business executive is bipolar disorder (answer b). This is suggested by her history of hypomania (as evidenced by her previous high productivity and extreme cleaning habits) followed by a current depressive episode (low mood, fatigue, and insomnia). The fact that she has also been losing weight intentionally, feels fat, and is worried about her weight is consistent with her hypomania phase. Anorexia nervosa (answer a) typically involves intense fear of gaining weight, while binge eating disorder (answer c) involves recurrent episodes of binge eating, neither of which fit the patient's symptoms. Hyperthyroidism (answer d) usually leads to weight loss, but the fact that the patient has intentionally lost weight and has a normal BMI makes hyperthyroidism less likely. Also, there are no other signs of hyperthyroidism mentioned in the history. Schizophrenia (answer e) is not consistent with the patient's symptoms, which do not include hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thoughts. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for this patient is bipolar disorder.",b,b,TRUE,
234. a woman brought her husband saying she wants the ‘thing’ on his forehead removed. the husband is refusing tx saying it improves his thinking. what is the most appropriate next step?,a. assess his mental capacity to refuse tx,b. remove lesion,c. refer to ed,d. mini-mental state exam,e. refuse surgery and send pt back,,,,,,key: the key is a. assess his mental capacity to refuse treatment.,"The correct answer to this question is A, assess his mental capacity to refuse treatment. This is the most appropriate next step because the husband is refusing treatment and claiming that the ""thing"" on his forehead improves his thinking. This suggests that he may not fully understand the implications of refusing treatment and may not have the mental capacity to make an informed decision. By assessing his mental capacity, healthcare professionals can determine if he is able to make decisions in his own best interest. 

The other answer choices are incorrect because removing the lesion (B) without consent would violate the husband's autonomy; referring to the ED (C) may not address the underlying issue of mental capacity; administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (D) may provide some insight into the husband's cognitive abilities but does not directly address his refusal of treatment; and refusing surgery and sending the patient back (E) does not provide any further information or actions to address the situation. Therefore, assessing mental capacity is the most appropriate next step in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

[antisocial personality disorder is a particularly challenging type of personality disorder, characterised by impulsive, irresponsible and often criminal behavior].","The most probable diagnosis for the 37-year-old man with a history of convictions, imprisonment, unsuccessful relationships, and neglecting his children is e) antisocial behavior disorder, also known as antisocial personality disorder. This disorder is characterized by impulsive, irresponsible, and often criminal behavior. People with this disorder have little regard for the needs or feelings of others and may engage in deceptive, manipulative, or abusive behaviors. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by unstable moods, self-image, and relationships, as well as impulsive behavior, but may not involve criminal behavior. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that often involves hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, but does not necessarily involve criminal behavior. Avoidant personality disorder involves a chronic pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism, which does not match the history of criminal behavior. Histrionic personality disorder involves attention-seeking behavior, excessive emotionality, and often exhibiting dramatic behaviors, which also does not match the history of criminal behavior. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for this patient is antisocial behavior disorder.",e,e,TRUE,
236. a 60 yo man has a pathological rib fx. he also complains of recurrent infection. bma is done. labs: ca2+ = 3.9mmol/l and alp = 127u/l. what type of cell would be found in abdundance in the marrow smear?,a. plasma cell,b. myeloid cell,c. bence-jones protein,d. megakaryocytes,e. reticulocytes,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is a. plasma cell. key: 2. the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. key: 3. points in favour: i) age 60 yrs ii) pathological rib fracture (from metastases) iii) recurrent infection (due to  b cell dysfunction (manifested as hypogammaglobulinemia), numerical and functional abnormalities of t cells, and dysfunction of natural killer cells), iv) raised calcium level.","The correct answer is A, plasma cell. The diagnosis is multiple myeloma, supported by the age of the patient, presence of pathological rib fracture (from metastases), recurrent infection (due to B cell dysfunction manifested as hypogammaglobulinemia), numerical and functional abnormalities of T cells and Natural killer cells, and raised calcium levels. In multiple myeloma, there is an overproduction of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to the secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins, bone destruction, and hypercalcemia. Therefore, the presence of plasma cells in abundance on the bone marrow smear is consistent with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Bence-Jones protein is a monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain component found in the urine of some patients with multiple myeloma, while myeloid cells, megakaryocytes, and reticulocytes are normally found in the bone marrow and are not specific to multiple myeloma.",a,a,TRUE,
"237. a child presents with blue marks on the sclera, short stature and heart murmur. what is the dx?",a. osteogenesis imperfect,b. hypopituitarism,c. vsd,d. achondrogenesis,e. dwarfism,,,,,,key: the key is a. osteogenesis imperfecta.,"The correct answer for this question is a. osteogenesis imperfecta. This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of collagen in the body, resulting in brittle bones, poor growth, and abnormal bone formation. The blue marks on the sclera are a classic sign of this condition, as the sclera is thin and translucent, which allows the underlying veins to show through. Short stature is also a common manifestation of osteogenesis imperfecta, as the bone growth is affected by the condition. The heart murmur seen in some individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta is typically due to aortic valve problems. Of the other choices provided, hypopituitarism is a condition in which the pituitary gland doesn't produce enough hormones, vsd (ventricular septal defect) is a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart and achondrogenesis is a type of dwarfism resulting from skeletal abnormalities. None of these conditions would present with all the symptoms seen in the child presented in the question stem, which is why they are incorrect choices.",a,a,TRUE,

At 5 months old, it is normal for a child to make sounds instead of speaking as they are still developing their language skills. Similarly, it is also normal for them to hold objects with their palms instead of fingers and be unable to sit independently. However, it is important to note that the child can hold her hand and sit when propped up against pillows, which indicates that the motor development is progressing normally. Therefore, options B, C, and D are incorrect as they suggest delays in specific areas of development that are not supported by the information provided.",a,a,TRUE,

[as there is no neurological deficit we can exclude any fracture by x-ray first]. [diagonal x ray means ,oblique view of cervical spine. by this view we can assess facet joint arthopathy. this doesn't related to rta].","The correct answer is b. X-ray. Since the woman did not complain of tingling or motor loss, it is safe to assume that there is no neurological deficit. Therefore, the most appropriate inv would be to exclude any fracture by taking an X-ray first. A diagonal X-ray, which is an oblique view of the cervical spine, can also assess facet joint arthropathy. It is important to note that an MRI or CT scan is not necessary at this stage and can be reserved for cases where there are signs of nerve damage or if the X-ray results are inconclusive. Therefore, options a, c, and d are incorrect in this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,
240. a young female who has many superficial lacerations was brought into the ed by her boyfriend for superficially lashing her upper arm. she is adamant and screaming that she is not suicidal but scared her boyfriend wants to leave her. what is the dx?,a. acute psychosis,b. severe depression,c. obsessive,d. bipolar,e. borderline personality,f. schizophrenia,,,,,"key: the key is acute psychosis. probably this is wrong key! correct key should be e. borderline personality disorder. [borderline personality disorder (bpd), also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder, is a long term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable relationships with other people, unstable sense of self, and unstable emotions.[3][4] there is often an extreme fear of abandonment, frequent dangerous behavior, a feeling of emptiness, and self-harm].","The correct answer to the given question is e. borderline personality disorder. This disorder is characterized by unstable relationships with others, unstable sense of self, and unstable emotions. People suffering from borderline personality disorder often experience an extreme fear of abandonment, engage in frequent dangerous behavior, feel a sense of emptiness, and may resort to self-harm. In this specific case, the young female's lacerations may be a manifestation of her struggle with abandonment, as she is frightened that her boyfriend wants to leave her. The other choices listed are incorrect as they do not fit the symptoms observed in the patient's behavior. Acute psychosis is unlikely as there are no indications of delusions or hallucinations, severe depression is unlikely as the patient is not expressing feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness, obsessive and bipolar disorders do not fit the observed symptoms, and schizophrenia typically involves delusions or hallucinations, which are not present in this case.",e,e,TRUE,
241. a 22yo woman was brought by her boyfriend with multiple superficial lacerations. there are scars of old cuts on her forearms. she is distressed because he wants to end the relationship. she denies suicide. what is the most likely dx?,a. acute psychosis,b. borderline personality disorder,c. severe depression,d. schizoid personality,e. psychotic depression,,,,,,"key: the key is b. borderline personality.

A diagnosis of acute psychosis is unlikely as there are no indications of delusions or hallucinations; severe depression is also unlikely as the self-harm behavior may suggest a more impulsive tendency rather than a lack of motivation; schizoid personality and psychotic depression are not indicated by the presented symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
"242. a 31yo single man lives with his mother. he usually drives to work. he always thinks when the traffic lights change, his mother is calling him, so he drives back home. what is the dx?",a. ocd,b. gad,c. schizophrenia,d. bipolar,e. cyclothymia,,,,,,key: the key is c. schizophrenia.  [ delusion of reference - he thinks that the changing traffic lights are giving message to him].,"The correct answer is c. schizophrenia. The man's belief that the changing traffic lights are giving messages to him is a delusion of reference, which is a symptom of schizophrenia. The other answer options are incorrect because OCD and GAD are anxiety disorders characterized by intrusive thoughts and excessive worrying respectively, bipolar disorder involves mood swings and cyclothymia is a mood disorder that involves periods of hypomania and depression that do not meet the criteria for bipolar disorder. Therefore, the man's symptoms are most consistent with schizophrenia.",c,c,TRUE,
243. a 56yo woman is known case of pernicious anemia. she refuses to take hydroxycobalamin im as she is needle shy. she asks for oral medication. why will oral meds be not effective?,a. intrinsic factor def,b. malabsorption,c. irritated gastric mucosa,d. lack of gastric acidity,,,,,,,key: the key is a. intrinsic factor def. [vitamin b12 cannot be absorbed without intrinsic factor].,"The correct answer is A, intrinsic factor deficiency. Pernicious anemia is caused by the body's inability to absorb vitamin B12, which is necessary for the production of red blood cells. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products and is bound to proteins called intrinsic factors in the stomach. Without intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to a deficiency. Oral medication cannot be effective because it bypasses the stomach and therefore the intrinsic factors that are needed for absorption. The other choices are incorrect because malabsorption and lack of gastric acidity are both related to intrinsic factor deficiency, and irritated gastric mucosa is not a known factor in pernicious anemia. Therefore, without proper absorption of vitamin B12 due to intrinsic factor deficiency, oral medication would not be effective in treating pernicious anemia.",a,a,TRUE,
"244. an 11m baby had an apnea event. the parents are worried that if something like this happens in the future, how they are to deal. advise them about infant cpr.",a. index and middle finger compression,b. compression with palm of one hand,c. compression with palm of two hands,d. compression with rescue breaths 30:2,e. compression with rescue breaths 15:2,,,,,,key: the key is a. index and middle finger compression.,"In the case of an 11-month-old baby experiencing an apnea event, the best way for parents to respond in the future is by performing infant CPR. The correct technique for infant CPR involves compression with the index and middle fingers rather than using the palm of one or two hands. Additionally, rescue breaths should be given in a 30:2 ratio, meaning 30 compressions should be followed by 2 rescue breaths. The incorrect answer choices include using the palm of one or two hands for compression or relying solely on rescue breaths without compressions. It is important for parents to learn and practice this technique to be prepared in case of emergency.",a,a,TRUE,
"245. a teacher brings in a child who says she fell down after hitting a table. on probing further, you decide that it was most probably an absence seizure. what led you to this dx?",a. the child had not eaten since morning,b. the child suddenly went blank and there was up-rolling of eyes,c. the child started moving his fingers uncontrollably before he fell,d. the child’s body became rigid and then started to jerk,,,,,,,key: the key is b. the child suddenly went blank and there was up-rolling of eyes.,"The correct answer is B. The child suddenly went blank and there was up-rolling of eyes, which are characteristic symptoms of an absence seizure. Option A is not relevant and does not provide any information to support a diagnosis of absence seizure. Option C describes another type of seizure called focal seizure, and option D describes a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Therefore, based on the information provided, option B is the most likely reason for suspecting an absence seizure.",b,b,TRUE,
246. a man has discharge from his left ear after a fight. where is the discharge coming from?,a. csf,b. inner ear,c. outer ear,d. brain,,,,,,,key: the key is a. csf. [probable fracture base of skull].,"The correct answer to the question ""where is the discharge coming from?"" is a) CSF. CSF stands for cerebrospinal fluid, which is found in the subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord. The man likely has a probable fracture at the base of his skull, which can cause a disruption in the flow of CSF and lead to a discharge from the ear. The other options, inner ear, outer ear, and brain, are unlikely sources of the discharge in this scenario. The inner and outer ear do not produce CSF, and brain discharge would typically present with more severe symptoms than just ear discharge. Therefore, the answer is a) CSF due to a probable fracture at the base of the skull.",a,a,TRUE,
247. a 40 yo manic depressive is noted to have high serum levels of lithium and profound hypokalemia. his gp had started him on anti-htns. choose the single most likely cause?,a. verapamil,b. amiodarone,c. ranitidine,d. lithium,e. thiazide,,,,,,key: the key is e. thiazide. [thiazide was prescribed for hpt and when lithium was prescribed its level increased due to thiazide and thiazide also caused hypokalemia resulting the given picture].,"The correct answer is e) thiazide. Thiazide was prescribed for hypertension, and when lithium was prescribed, the thiazide increased its level. In addition to this, thiazide also caused hypokalemia which resulted in the given symptoms. The other choices are not the most likely cause because verapamil and amiodarone are used to treat heart-related problems, ranitidine is used for acid reflux, and lithium is already being taken by the patient. Therefore, the thiazide medication is the most likely cause for the high lithium levels and profound hypokalemia in this patient.",e,e,TRUE,
248. a 74yo man presents with weakness in his arm and leg from which he recovered within a few days and short term memory loss. he has an extensor plantar response. he has similar episodes 2 years ago and became unable to identify objects and to make proper judgment. what is the most appropriate dx?,a. alcoholic dementia,b. pick’s dementia,c. huntington’s disease,d. alzheimer’s disease,e. vascular dementia,,,,,,"key: the key is e. vascular dementia. [hemiparesis, memory impairment, extensor planter reflex, inability to identify objects, poor judgment are features of strokes and thus vascular dementia].","The most appropriate diagnosis for the 74-year-old man presenting with weakness in his arm and leg, short-term memory loss, extensor plantar response, inability to identify objects and poor judgment is vascular dementia. The key ""e"" signifies this answer. The presence of hemiparesis, memory impairment, extensor plantar reflex, inability to identify objects, and poor judgment are features of strokes and thus vascular dementia. The other answer options are not the correct diagnoses for the symptoms presented. Alcoholic dementia is caused by excessive alcohol consumption, Pick's dementia and Huntington's disease are genetic disorders that present with different symptoms, and Alzheimer's disease typically presents with memory loss and cognitive decline but not with hemiparesis and extensor plantar reflex.",e,e,TRUE,
249. a nurse comes to you saying that she has recently developed the habit of washing her hands after every 15-20 mins. she is unable to conc on her work and takes longer than before to finish tasks as she must constantly wash her hands. what is the most appropriate management?,a. cbt,b. ssri,c. ect,d. antipsychotics,e. desensitization,,,,,,key: 1. the key is a. cbt. key: 2. the diagnosis is ocd.,"The most appropriate management for the nurse in this scenario would be cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as indicated by the key. This is because the nurse is exhibiting symptoms consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is a type of anxiety disorder that can be effectively treated with CBT. CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the symptoms of OCD. Options b, c, d, and e are not appropriate in this case because medication (SSRIs, antipsychotics) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are typically reserved for more severe cases of OCD, whereas desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that may be helpful for some individuals with OCD, but should only be considered as a second-line treatment option after CBT has been tried.",a,a,TRUE,
"250. a 61yo man underwent a surgery in which ileal resection had been done. he complains of fatigue, headache, and heart racing. labs: mcv=108fl, hgb=8.9g/dl. what is the most likely dx?",a. vit b12 def,b. iron def,c. folate def,d. hemolytic anemia,e. anemia of chronic disease,,,,,,key: 1. the key is vit. b12 deficiency. key: 2. vit b12 is absorbed mostly in ileum. [as ileal resection is done b12 is not absorbed leading to megaloblastic anaemia].,"The correct answer for this question is a) Vitamin B12 deficiency. This is because the patient underwent ileal resection which leads to inadequate absorption of Vitamin B12, leading to megaloblastic anemia. The patient's symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and rapid heartbeat are also consistent with this type of anemia. Iron deficiency anemia presents with low MCV, whereas folate deficiency typically presents with normal or slightly elevated MCV. Hemolytic anemia would have low hemoglobin levels with an elevated reticulocyte count. Anemia of chronic disease presents with low MCV and normal to low hemoglobin levels. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Vitamin B12 deficiency.",a,a,TRUE,

CF affects the production of sweat, respiratory and digestive fluids, causing them to become thicker than normal, which predisposes the patient to infections of the lungs and gastrointestinal system, as pointed out in the second key. Options b, c, d, and e, which include SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency), primary T-cell, and primary B-cell immunodeficiencies, and malabsorption, respectively, do not align with the presented symptoms, making them incorrect choices. Therefore, in this particular case, CF is the most probable diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
252. a 3yo child has a high temp for 4 days and he had not seen a doctor. then mother notices rashes on buccal mucosa and some around the mouth. what is the most appropriate dx?,a. measles,b. roseola infectiosum,c. rubella,d. chicken pox,e. impetigo,,,,,,key: the key is b. roseola infectiosum. it is a wrong key! the correct key should be a. measles! [rash on buccal mucosa (koplicks spot) are characteristic of measles. also as the rash developed after 4 days fever the dx is measles!].,"The most appropriate diagnosis for this 3-year-old child with high fever for 4 days and rashes on buccal mucosa and around the mouth is measles (answer option a). The characteristic rash on buccal mucosa, also known as Koplik spots, is specific to measles. Moreover, the development of the rash after 4 days of fever is also indicative of measles. Therefore, option b (roseola infectiosum), c (rubella), d (chickenpox), and e (impetigo) are all incorrect diagnoses. Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can lead to severe complications, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent spread and ensure the child's recovery.",a,a,TRUE,
253. a 70yo lady presents with fever for 3d and confusion. there is no significant pmh. what is the most probable dx?,a. delirium,b. hypoglycemia,c. alzheimers,d. dka,,,,,,,"key: the key is a. delirium. delirium is an acute confusional state and declined cognitive function which involves changes in arousal (hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed), perceptual deficits, altered sleep-wake cycle, and psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions.","The most probable diagnosis for a 70-year-old woman with a 3-day history of fever and confusion and no significant past medical history is delirium. Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by declined cognitive function and changes in arousal, often presenting with symptoms such as altered sleep-wake cycles, perceptual deficits, and psychotic features like hallucinations and delusions. Hypoglycemia, Alzheimer's disease, and DKA are less likely diagnoses in this case because they do not typically present with acute fever and confusion without a significant past medical history. Therefore, the correct answer is a, delirium.",a,a,TRUE,
254. an obese mother suffers from osas. which of the following inv is best for her?,a. abg,b. overnight pulse-oximetry,c. polysomnography,d. eeg,,,,,,,key: the key is b. overnight pulse-oxymetry. [it is already a diagnosed case of osas. so no need for reconfirmation with polysomnography. if like to know the current status or monitor overnight pulse oxymetry is good].,"The correct answer for an obese mother suffering from OSAS is overnight pulse-oximetry (choice b) which is a non-invasive diagnostic test that measures the oxygen saturation level during sleep. As the patient is already diagnosed with OSAS, there is no need for reconfirmation with other invasive diagnostic tests such as polysomnography (choice c) or EEG (choice d). ABG (choice a) is not a recommended diagnostic test for OSAS. Therefore, overnight pulse-oximetry is the most appropriate and effective test for monitoring the current status of the patient's sleep disorder.",b,b,TRUE,

[worry about having a serious illness].,"The correct answer is b. hypochondriac. The patient's persistent worry about being infected with HIV despite negative test results suggests a hypochondriacal disorder. Individuals with hypochondriasis have a preoccupation with the possibility of having a serious illness, or a belief that they have a disease despite medical evidence to the contrary. This disorder often causes significant distress and impairment in functioning. The other answer options are not appropriate in this scenario as they do not describe the patient's symptoms accurately. Somatization disorder involves physical symptoms but is not specific to a particular disease, whereas Munchausen's syndrome involves self-inflicted illness for attention seeking purposes. OCD involves obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors that are unrelated to illness concerns, and schizophrenia involves hallucinations and delusions, which are not present in this patient's presentation.",b,b,TRUE,

The presentation of the child with progressive cyanosis, poor feeding, tachypnea over the first 2 weeks of life and a holosystolic murmur suggests a congenital heart defect. The specific condition that fits these symptoms is tricuspid atresia, which is a rare condition where the tricuspid valve, which separates the right atrium and ventricle, does not form properly. This leads to decreased blood flow in the right ventricle, causing cyanosis and poor feeding. The other choices listed in the question, such as ASD, VSD, PDA, and TOF, do not fit the symptoms described and are therefore incorrect.",c,c,TRUE,

The woman's history and symptoms point towards a basilar migraine diagnosis, which can cause a loss of consciousness and normal imaging results. Additionally, the neurological examination was normal, further reducing the need for invasive investigations.

The key features of elevated mood, increased energy, and heightened productivity are common to both mania and hypomania. However, the absence of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations rules out the possibility of mania. The other options such as atypical depression, marked depression, bipolar syndrome, and psychosis are not the most likely diagnoses based on the symptoms described.

This therapy is specifically tailored to target the root cause of her suicidal thoughts, which may stem from familial, financial, or occupational stressors. CBT, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and ECT may be effective for those with specific mental health conditions, but they are not appropriate for this patient who has no such diagnoses. It is essential to identify and address the underlying problems that are leading to her suicidal ideation, and problem-focused therapy is the most appropriate treatment for achieving this goal.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient's age, spleen size, anemia, and high white blood cell count all fit with a diagnosis of CML. AML (acute myelogenous leukemia) and CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) are not likely choices because the patient's symptoms and lab results are not consistent with those diseases. Polycythemia is also not likely because the platelet count is not elevated and the symptoms are not consistent with this condition.

PDA stands for patent ductus arteriosus, which is a condition where the connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta that is present in all fetuses fails to close after birth. This results in abnormal blood flow between the two vessels, which can lead to a heart murmur. The other options are less likely given the description of the case. TOF (tetralogy of Fallot), a congenital heart defect characterized by four abnormalities in the heart's structure, would not typically present as a temporary murmur that resolves spontaneously. An aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva or an aorto-pulmonary septal defect would also not typically present in this way, and an AVM (arteriovenous malformation) is not related to the heart. Management of PDA typically involves medications like indomethacin to close the connection, or prostaglandin E1 to keep it open in cases where surgical repair is planned.",a,a,TRUE,

This investigation is important as it helps to assess the levels of various electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, which can affect the functioning of the nervous system. An abnormal level of these electrolytes can be a potential cause for the seizure and treating it may prevent further seizures. The other options are not appropriate in this case; an ABG is used to assess oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood, an ECG is used to assess heart function and blood glucose is measured to assess sugar levels in the blood. Therefore, b. serum electrolytes is the most appropriate investigation to perform for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

A TIA is a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain, resulting in neurological symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. Stroke and intracranial hemorrhage would have resulted in more permanent neurological deficits, and vestibular insufficiency would not explain the urinary incontinence. Therefore, the symptoms and recovery time suggest a TIA, and further evaluation and risk factor management are necessary to prevent a possible future stroke.",c,c,TRUE,

This diagnosis is supported by several factors present in the patient's history and exam. The patient's symptoms of headache, dizziness, tinnitus, and visual problems suggest hyperviscosity, a common complication in polycythemia vera. Additionally, the presence of pruritus after a hot bath and splenomegaly are also indicative of polycythemia vera. The lab results of elevated RBC count, hemoglobin, and platelets further support this diagnosis. The other answer choices are incorrect as they are not consistent with the patient's symptoms, history, or lab results. CML and myelofibrosis are characterized by anemia and thrombocytopenia, while CLL and NHL typically do not present with hyperviscosity or splenomegaly.",c,c,TRUE,

Blood glucose. In cases where a patient is brought in an unconscious state, measuring the blood glucose levels is crucial as it can help diagnose hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions. A low blood glucose level can lead to unconsciousness, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Therefore, measuring the patient's blood glucose level should be the initial investigation. The other options (a. CT, c. ABG, d. MRI, and e. CBC) are not effective in the diagnosis of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and should not be the initial investigation in such cases.",b,b,TRUE,

The red, swollen, exudating ulcer on the nipple and areola of the right breast with a palpable lump under the ulcer are indicative of breast cancer. The infiltration of the lymphatics by the carcinomatous cells causes the swelling and exudation of the ulcer. Choices a and c are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the skin condition, which is breast cancer. Inflammatory cells releasing cytokines and infiltration of the malignant skin cells into the breast tissue may be associated with cancer, but they do not explain the specific symptoms presented by the patient in this case. Therefore, b is the correct answer because it accurately describes the cause of the patient's skin condition.",b,b,TRUE,

[spermatozoa itself acts as a carcinogen!!! so barrier method is the best protection from the given option!!].,"The correct answer to this question is b. barrier method. This is because the young lady is concerned about cervical cancer and there is evidence to suggest that the presence of spermatozoa itself can act as a carcinogen. Therefore, the barrier method, which physically prevents semen from entering the cervix, is the best form of protection in this case. The other options listed (a. pop, c. iucd, d. cocp, and e. ius) do not provide the same level of protection against the potential carcinogenic effects of sperm in the cervix. It is important for the young lady to discuss her concerns and options with her GP to determine the most appropriate method of contraception for her individual needs.",b,b,TRUE,

As the patient had a hemicolectomy, he might experience postoperative complications such as urinary retention. The catheter might have gotten dislodged or might be clogged, which can cause a decrease in urine output. Option a(iv fluids) can also be considered, but it should be done only after checking the catheter for blockages. Blood transfusion (b) and dialysis (c) are not relevant in the given context. Administering furosemide (d) is also not appropriate until the cause of the decreased urine output is identified. Therefore, checking the catheter is the most appropriate next step that needs to be taken to address the situation.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because the concentration of adrenaline in 1:1000 is higher than the other options, making it the most effective choice for treating anaphylactic shock. Option B, 0.5ml of 1:10000, has a lower concentration and may not be as effective in treating the condition. Option C, 1ml of 1:500, has a higher concentration and may cause adverse effects. Option D, 5ml of 1:1000, is excessive and could result in overdosing the patient. Option E, 0.05ml of 1:100, is too weak a dose and may not be effective in treating the condition.

This is because abnormal bleeding could be due to a bleeding disorder, making it important to examine the patient's clotting mechanism. Other options such as hysterectomy, endometrial biopsy, CBC, and high vaginal swab are not as relevant and would not provide as much useful information in this case. A hysterectomy could be an option in situations where other treatments have failed, but it is not the first line of investigation in this case. Endometrial biopsy could be considered if there is a suspicion of cancer or hyperplasia, but this is not the case here as the ultrasound was normal. CBC and high vaginal swab would not provide any useful information regarding the cause of abnormal bleeding. Therefore, a coagulation profile is the most appropriate investigation to determine if a bleeding disorder is contributing to the patient's symptoms.",e,e,TRUE,

Esophageal manometry involves measuring the pressure activity of the esophagus and determining the strength and coordination of the muscles involved in swallowing. In cases of dysphagia, it is important to differentiate between a mechanical obstruction and a motility disorder such as achalasia. In achalasia, the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax properly during swallowing, leading to difficulty in passing food through the esophagus. Other imaging modalities such as CXR and MRI may be helpful in identifying structural abnormalities but are not helpful in diagnosing motility disorders. Esophageal biopsy may be useful in cases of suspected esophageal cancer but not in cases of dysphagia without other concerning symptoms. Treatment options for achalasia include oral medication such as nitrates or CCB, balloon dilatation of the sphincter, and oesophagomyotomy (surgical cutting of the sphincter). Overall, esophageal manometry is the single most useful investigation in cases of dysphagia, as it helps to accurately diagnose motility disorders such as achalasia and guide appropriate treatment.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because the presenting symptoms suggest endometriosis, and pelvic ultrasound is the initial investigation of choice for this condition. Pelvic ultrasound can help identify any cysts or masses caused by endometriosis, as well as help rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Laparoscopy may be considered if initial investigations are inconclusive, or if surgery is necessary for treatment, but it is not the initial investigation. Hysteroscopy and vaginal swabs are not appropriate investigations for endometriosis, as they do not provide information about the pelvic organs.",b,b,TRUE,

[www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/gtg52/].,"The correct answer is D, secondary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). This is because the patient presented with abnormal bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally, which is the definition of secondary PPH. The patient's symptoms indicate that there is excessive blood loss, associated with a drop in blood pressure, elevated heart rate, fever, and a swollen, tender uterus. The other choices can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation. Abruption of placenta 2nd to pre-eclampsia usually occurs before delivery, not postpartum. Concealed hemorrhage is unlikely since the patient is presenting with visible blood clots, and primary PPH occurs in the first 24 hours after delivery. Retained placenta would cause continuous bleeding and not just intermittent bleeding with clots. Scabies is not related to the patient's symptoms and is not a possible answer.",d,d,TRUE,

Antiphospholipid syndrome is a condition that increases the risk of blood clots, which can lead to miscarriages during pregnancy. Aspirin and heparin are the recommended treatment to reduce the risk of blood clots and improve the chances of a successful pregnancy. Warfarin (choice b) is contraindicated during pregnancy and can cause fetal harm. Heparin alone (choice d) is not the first line of treatment, as aspirin has also been shown to have a positive effect on reducing blood clot risk. Warfarin alone (choice e) is also contraindicated during pregnancy and should not be used. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is a combination of aspirin and heparin.",c,c,TRUE,

The symptoms mentioned are consistent with early pregnancy, which is further supported by the delayed menstruation. Referring the patient to an op psychiatry or op ent would not be appropriate as there are no symptoms indicating a psychological or ENT issue. CT or MRI brain scans are unnecessary as the symptoms do not suggest any neurological problems. Therefore, performing a b-hcg dipstick test would be the next appropriate step to confirm or rule out a pregnancy as the cause of these symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,
277. a 16yo girl came to the sexual clinic. she complains of painful and heavy bleeding. she says she doesn’t a regular cycle. what is the most appropriate management?,a. mini pill,b. combined pill,c. ius,d. anti-prostoglandins,e. anti-fibrinolytics,,,,,,key: the key is b. combined pill.,"The correct answer is B, the combined pill. This is because it can regulate the hormonal level of a woman's menstrual cycle and decrease the severity of the painful and heavy bleeding. The mini pill, IUS, anti-prostaglandins, and anti-fibrinolytics are not suitable for this situation. The mini pill contains only one hormone, which may not be effective in regulating the menstrual cycle. The IUS may cause irregular bleeding before it settles, and it may not be effective immediately. Anti-prostaglandins are used to relieve menstrual pain but not for heavy and painful bleeding in every case. Anti-fibrinolytics are used to reduce bleeding during or after surgery, but they are not recommended for treating menstrual bleeding. Therefore, the combined pill is the better option as it can address both the painful and heavy bleeding and regulate the hormonal fluctuations that occur during a woman's menstrual cycle.",b,b,TRUE,

A delusion of grandeur is a false belief that one possesses great power, wealth, or importance. In this scenario, the man believes that he owns the bank, which is an extreme exaggeration of his actual abilities and role in society. This belief is not based in reality and is a clear example of a delusion of grandeur. Delusion of reference involves believing that events or actions are directed towards oneself, delusion of control involves believing that one's thoughts or actions are being controlled by external forces, delusion of guilt involves believing that one has committed a serious offense, and delusion of persecution involves believing that one is being targeted or harassed by others. None of these delusions fit the scenario described in the question, making them all incorrect choices.",e,e,TRUE,
279. which method of contraception can cause the risk of ectopic pregnancy?,a. cocp,b. iucd,c. mirena,d. pop,,,,,,,key: the key is b. iucd.,"The correct answer is b. IUCD. Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancies as they may prevent the fertilized egg from traveling down the fallopian tubes and implanting in the uterus. This can lead to the fertilized egg implanting in the fallopian tubes, which is called an ectopic pregnancy, and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Choice a, cocp (combined oral contraceptive pill), does not increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy as it works mainly by preventing ovulation. Choices c and d, Mirena (a hormonal IUCD) and POP (progestogen-only pill), also do not significantly increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. It is important to discuss the potential risks and benefits of any contraception method with a healthcare provider to determine the best option based on individual circumstances.",b,b,TRUE,

Intrinsic factor deficiency affects oral B12 utilization. Pernicious anemia is a condition where the body fails to produce enough intrinsic factor, a protein that binds to B12 and enables its absorption in the small intestine. Without intrinsic factor, oral B12 supplements would not be absorbed efficiently and would likely fail to relieve the symptoms of pernicious anemia. Intramuscular B12 injections are the preferred treatment option for this condition because they bypass the need for intrinsic factor and are directly absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to a faster and more effective response. Choices a, c, d, and e are incorrect because they are unrelated to the underlying condition of intrinsic factor deficiency in pernicious anemia and do not address the specific concerns of the patient's needle phobia or swallowing difficulties.",b,b,TRUE,

The old man's complaint of a rotten body part aligns with this delusion. Option a, guilt, does not fit the scenario as the old man is not expressing remorse for violating a moral standard. Option b, hypochondriasis, involves excessive worry about having a serious illness, which is not what the old man is reporting. Option c, Munchausen's, involves feigning illness for attention or reassurance, which does not apply to the old man's situation either. Option e, Capgras syndrome, involves the belief that a loved one has been replaced by an impostor, which also does not fit this scenario.

The patient's history of chronic alcoholism and liver damage further supports this diagnosis. Korsakoff psychosis (choice A) is a chronic memory disorder that can result from untreated Wernicke's encephalopathy. Delirium tremens (choice B) typically occurs during alcohol withdrawal and includes symptoms of severe confusion, hallucinations, and tremors, which this patient is not presenting.

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy, acute pyelonephritis, cholecystitis, and acute hepatitis are all differential diagnoses that may share some symptoms with HELLP, but do not fulfill the criteria of all three components. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is characterized by prolonged vomiting, jaundice, and coagulopathy. Acute pyelonephritis presents with fever, flank pain, and dysuria. Cholecystitis is associated with severe right upper quadrant pain and fever. Acute hepatitis presents with jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Therefore, D is the correct answer for this question, and it is important to promptly diagnose and manage this condition to prevent serious complications and poor outcomes for both the mother and baby.",d,d,TRUE,
"285. a 57yo woman presents with dysuria, frequency and urinary incontinence. she complains of dyspareunia. urine culture has been done and is sterile. what is the most appropriate step?",a. oral antibiotics,b. topical antibiotics,c. topical estrogen,d. oral estrogen,e. oral antibiotics and topical estrogen,,,,,,key: the key is c. topical estrogen. [there may be uti like symptoms and dyspareunia in atrophic vaginitis for which topical oestrogen can be used].,"The key to this question is c - topical estrogen. Atrophic vaginitis can cause symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, dyspareunia, and urinary incontinence, which can be mistaken for a urinary tract infection. However, if a urine culture comes back as sterile, it is unlikely to be a UTI. Topical estrogen can be used to treat the underlying atrophic vaginitis and alleviate the associated symptoms. Oral antibiotics (a) and topical antibiotics (b) are not appropriate as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. Oral estrogen (d) may also be helpful in treating atrophic vaginitis, but topical estrogen is a more targeted approach. Choosing both oral antibiotics and topical estrogen (e) is not necessary as there is no indication of a bacterial infection.",c,c,TRUE,

[patient had previous pid. current symptoms of severe cervical motion tenderness with significant rise of temperature is very much suggestive of pelvic abscess].,"Based on the patient's symptoms, the appropriate investigation would be option a, an ultrasound (US). The patient's history of PID and the current symptoms of severe cervical motion tenderness and a significant rise in temperature make a pelvic abscess likely. An ultrasound can help identify any abscesses or fluid collections in the pelvic region. Abdominal X-rays, CT scans, high vaginal exams, and endocervical swabs would not provide as much information as an ultrasound in this scenario and would not be helpful in diagnosing a pelvic abscess.",a,a,TRUE,

Paracetamol. This is because paracetamol is safe for use during pregnancy and is considered the first-line treatment for pain relief in pregnant women with osteoarthritis. Steroids and NSAIDs are not recommended during pregnancy as they can have harmful effects on the developing fetus. Paracetamol with dihydrocodeine and pethidine are also not recommended during pregnancy as they can have adverse effects on the fetus and may cause respiratory depression in the newborn. In conclusion, paracetamol is the best choice of drug for a pregnant woman with osteoarthritis due to its safety profile and effectiveness in pain relief.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the child has a clean cut wound, and is not vaccinated against tetanus or any other vaccine-preventable diseases. Tetanus is a serious disease caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani and can be fatal if not treated promptly. Therefore, it is important to give the complete DPT vaccine course, which includes tetanus toxoid, to provide immunity against tetanus, as well as diphtheria and pertussis. The other options are not the correct choices because cleaning and dressing the wound alone will not provide immunity against tetanus and other diseases, giving only the TT vaccine will not protect the child against diphtheria and pertussis, and giving only the DPT vaccine without tetanus immune globulin (TIG) will not be enough to provide immediate protection against tetanus.",e,e,TRUE,
290. a 32yo female who has had 3 prv miscarriages in the 1st trimester now comes with vaginal bleeding at 8wks. us reveals a viable fetus. what would be the most appropriate definitive management?,a. admit,b. aspirin,c. bed rest 2 weeks,d. cervical cerclage,e. no tx,,,,,,key: the key is b. aspirin. [early miscarriage is more common in antiphospholipid syndrome and treated with heparin or aspirin when become pregnant].,"The correct answer is b. aspirin. This is because the woman's history of previous miscarriages and antiphospholipid syndrome increase her risk for early miscarriage. Aspirin can help to improve blood flow to the placenta and reduce the risk of miscarriage in such cases. Admitting the patient or placing her on bed rest may not be necessary unless she develops other complications or symptoms. Cervical cerclage would be indicated if the woman had a history of cervical incompetence, but this is not mentioned in the case. Not providing any treatment at all could increase the risk of miscarriage. Therefore, the most appropriate definitive management for this patient would be to start her on aspirin.",b,b,TRUE,

[this is not nocturnal enuresis but diurnal enuresis. in diurnal enuresis desmopressin is not recommended. behavioral training is mainstay of treatment in diurnal enuresis].,"The correct answer for this question is d. behavioral training. This is because the girl is experiencing diurnal enuresis, which is the involuntary loss of urine during waking hours. Desmopressin is not recommended for diurnal enuresis, as it is typically used for nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting at night). Sleep alarms may be effective for nocturnal enuresis, but they are not appropriate for diurnal enuresis. Reassurance alone is not enough to treat the condition, and imipramine carries a risk of side effects and is not recommended as a first-line treatment. Behavior training, on the other hand, is the mainstay of treatment for diurnal enuresis, which involves bladder training techniques, timed voiding, and scheduled toileting. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for the 6-year-old girl experiencing diurnal enuresis is behavioral training.",d,d,TRUE,

This patient is presenting with symptoms of eclampsia, which is a life-threatening complication of pregnancy characterized by seizures. The first-line treatment for eclampsia is magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to prevent seizures and improve outcomes for both the mother and baby. Choice B - 2g MgSO4 IV bolus and D - 4g MgSO4 IV bolus are incorrect because bolus administration of MgSO4 can lead to toxicity and should not be used as an initial treatment. Choice C - 2g MgSO4 in 500ml NS in 1h is also incorrect because this is a slower infusion rate compared to the recommended dose for treating eclampsia. Choice E - 10mg Diazepam in 500ml 0.9%NS in 1h is also incorrect because although diazepam is an anticonvulsant, it is not the recommended first-line treatment for eclampsia.",a,a,TRUE,

[both a and d are correct answer as barrett’s oesophagus is a change known as metaplasia].,"Barrett's Esophagus is a pathological change characterized by the replacement of the normal squamous epithelial lining in the lower esophagus with columnar epithelium. This change is known as metaplasia, making both options A and D correct answers to the question. It is important to note that options B, C, and E are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the pathological change in Barrett's Esophagus. The replacement of squamous epithelium with columnar epithelium in the lower esophagus puts individuals at a higher risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, a more aggressive form of cancer. Therefore, early detection and treatment may prevent the progression of Barrett's Esophagus to cancer.",a or d,a or d,TRUE,

[features described are consistent with cerebellar lesion].,"Based on the symptoms described, the site of the lesion is likely the cerebellum. This is because ataxia (lack of coordination), nystagmus (involuntary eye movement), and vertigo (dizziness) are common features of cerebellar dysfunction. The auditory canal or 8th cranial nerve (choice b) might cause symptoms related to hearing, but not the described symptoms. The cerebral hemisphere (choice d) could cause a range of symptoms, but not typically ataxia. The brain stem (choice e) could also cause ataxia, but is less likely given the combination of nystagmus and vertigo. Therefore, the best answer is c. cerebellum.",c,c,TRUE,

[sodium valproate has no effect on cocp].,"The correct answer for this question is (e) - she can use cocp. The key information here is the medication she is currently taking, sodium valproate, which has no effect on cocp. Therefore, she can safely use it for contraception. Option (a) is incorrect as it states she cannot use cocp, which is not true. Option (b) is also incorrect as it suggests that she can use cocp with extra precaution, but there is no need for extra precaution in this case. Option (c) is incorrect as it suggests changing her medication to carbamazepine, which is unnecessary if she is already stable on sodium valproate. Option (d) is incorrect as it suggests using higher doses of estrogen and progesterone, which is not required in this situation. Option (e) is correct as there are no contraindications for her to use cocp while taking sodium valproate.",e,e,TRUE,

The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and was treated with antibiotics. However, the recurrence of symptoms, such as lower abdominal pain and fever, suggests a resistant condition like abscess formation. A vaginal or endocervical swab would not be the most appropriate next management as it would not provide information on the presence of an abscess. An abdominal x-ray would not be useful in this case as it does not provide detailed images of the pelvic area. A laparoscopy, while a useful diagnostic tool, is more invasive and not the first-line approach. Therefore, an ultrasound would be the most appropriate next management as it would provide detailed images of the pelvic region, allowing for detection of abscess formation or any other abnormalities.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because a VSD commonly presents with these symptoms, specifically the loud murmur and heave/thrill, which is caused by the leakage of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle due to the opening in the septum between them. The other choices (ASD, TOF, PDA, TGA) do not usually present with the same symptoms, or they may have different accompanying signs. Therefore, VSD is the most likely diagnosis given the presenting symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[case of meningitis. lp will confirm the diagnosis].,"The correct answer to confirm the diagnosis of the young girl presenting with fever, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, and photophobia is option C: lumbar puncture (LP). LP helps to confirm the diagnosis of meningitis, an inflammation of the tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord, which presents with these symptoms. Blood culture (option A) is not the most appropriate test, as it only helps in identifying the causative microbe and not confirming meningitis. Blood glucose (option B) is not relevant as it does not aid in diagnosing meningitis. CXR (option D) is not useful in confirming meningitis as it only helps to identify lung-related problems. CT (option E) may help in identifying brain lesions, but again, it cannot confirm meningitis. Therefore, LP is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of meningitis in this case.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the symptoms are on the left half of his body, indicating a lesion on the right side of the brain. Moreover, the picture is consistent with a lacunar infarction of the internal capsule. Option c, right midbrain, is less likely as it would involve cranial nerve involvement, which is not mentioned in the symptoms. Option a, left parietal lobe, and option d, left frontal lobe, are incorrect as they represent the opposite side of the brain to where the symptoms are presenting. In conclusion, the answer is b, right internal capsule, as it is the most likely location for these symptoms to occur.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient's history and physical exam findings suggest a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, which is a medical emergency. The patient is exhibiting signs of shock and needs urgent surgical intervention. Laparoscopy (B), salpingotomy (C), salpingectomy (D), and MTX (E) are not appropriate in this case as they do not address the immediate need for surgical intervention to manage the acute hemorrhage and prevent further complications. Delayed or ineffective management can lead to severe bleeding, sepsis, and even death. Therefore, immediate laparotomy is crucial in this situation.",a,a,TRUE,
"302. a woman presents with complains of abdominal pain, unsteadiness, numbness of lower limb and palpitations. all inv are normal. what is the dx?",a. manchausen,b. somatization,c. hypochondriac,d. bipolar,,,,,,,"key: the key is b. somatization. [this is multiple, recurrent, medically unexplained symptoms usually starting early in life. usually patient presents with one symptom at a time. investigations are normal].","The correct answer for this question is b. somatization. This is because somatization is characterized by the presence of multiple, recurrent, medically unexplained symptoms that usually start early in life. In this case, the patient is complaining of abdominal pain, unsteadiness, numbness of the lower limb, and palpitations. It is important to note that patients with somatization typically present one symptom at a time, and all investigations usually come back normal. The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's symptoms or presentation. Manchausen syndrome is a psychological disorder in which individuals fabricate or exaggerate symptoms for attention, while hypochondriasis is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive worry and fear about having a serious illness.

In sarcoidosis, uncontrolled synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by macrophages leads to an increased absorption of calcium in the intestine and to increased resorption of calcium in bone. This results in hypercalcemia, which can lead to the formation of kidney stones. Hyperuricemia (choice b), diet (choice c), recurrent UTIs (choice d), and hyperparathyroidism (choice e) can also all cause kidney stones, but these are less likely in this case given the patient's medical history and the known association between sarcoidosis and hypercalcemia.",a,a,TRUE,

Tidal volume refers to the amount of air that is inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing. During pregnancy, physiological changes occur to accommodate the growing fetus, which causes an increase in tidal volume. Therefore, option A is not a physiological change during pregnancy because tidal volume actually increases rather than remains the same. Options B, C, D, and E are all physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. Red blood cell volume increases to accommodate the increased need for oxygen, cardiac output also increases to supply blood to the growing fetus, uterus weight increases as it expands to accommodate the growing fetus, and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) increases as part of the body's immune response during pregnancy.",a,a,TRUE,
305. a 10yo boy presents with nose bleed. what measure should be taken to stop the bleeding?,a. press base of the nose,b. ice packs,c. press soft parts of the nose,d. start tranexemic acid,e. iv fluids,,,,,,key: the key is c. press soft parts of the nose.,"In the case of a 10-year-old boy with nose bleeding, the correct measure to stop the bleeding is to press the soft parts of the nose. This is because this area contains a network of blood vessels that are responsible for supplying blood to the nasal mucosa. By applying pressure to this area, the bleeding can be stopped more effectively. Options such as pressing the base of the nose or the use of ice packs may not be as effective as pressing the soft parts of the nose. Starting tranexamic acid or administering IV fluids are not recommended as the first line of treatment for nose bleeding. Therefore, pressing the soft parts of the nose is the most appropriate measure to stop the bleeding.",c,c,TRUE,

This is based on the recommendations in the 2007 NICE guideline amended in 2013, which suggest treatment with ACE inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, and statins for all people who have had an acute MI. In this case, the patient is already taking one of the recommended treatments (aspirin), but adding a statin and an ACE inhibitor would provide additional benefits for cardiovascular health, such as reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes. Option b (statin + warfarin) is not recommended as warfarin is primarily used for patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions that increase the risk of blood clots. Option c (low cholesterol diet) is helpful for overall health but may not provide sufficient protection against further cardiovascular events. Therefore, option d - statin + ACE inhibitor - is the most appropriate choice for this patient.",d,d,TRUE,

[most vulnerable structure is intercostal nerve, then intercostal artery then intercostals vein. as intercostal nerve is not in option intercostal artery is the answer here].","The correct answer to the question is c. intercostal artery. This is because when a chest drain is placed below the 4th rib in the mid-axillary line, the intercostal artery is at particular risk of injury. The intercostal nerve is also vulnerable, but it is not an option in this question. The other answer choices - arzygos vein, diaphragm, internal thoracic artery, and liver - are not at high risk of injury in this scenario. Therefore, the intercostal artery is the single structure at the greatest risk of injury in this situation.",c,c,TRUE,

Surgery (option a) is not usually necessary for UTIs, and increasing fluids (option c) and toilet training (option d) may be helpful in preventing UTIs but may not be sufficient in cases of recurring infections. Laxatives (option e) are not a recommended intervention for UTIs. UTIs should be treated promptly to avoid complications, and if the child experiences recurrent infections, a healthcare provider may recommend prophylactic antibiotics to prevent future infections.",b,b,TRUE,

This is supported by two reasons: diminished arterial perfusion of the kidneys due to spasm of the feeding artery secondary to the bleeding, and DIC secondary to the same cause. Post viral infection, acute papillary necrosis, HUS, and renal vein thrombosis are less likely causes in this scenario. Acute papillary necrosis typically results from long-term, high-dose use of analgesics or chronic kidney diseases. HUS is more often associated with gastroenteritis caused by Escherichia coli or Shigella. Renal vein thrombosis may result from complications of pregnancy, such as deep venous thrombosis. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and the provided information, acute cortical necrosis is the most likely diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,

Decompensated cirrhosis is a severe condition in which the liver has been significantly damaged and can no longer function properly, leading to various complications such as ascites, bleeding varices, encephalopathy, and jaundice. In this case, ascites is a common symptom of decompensated cirrhosis, and the yellow color of the ascetic fluid indicates the presence of bilirubin, which is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells and often seen in liver disease. Alcoholic hepatitis is a possible cause of yellowing of the ascetic fluid, but it is an acute condition that typically resolves with abstinence from alcohol, whereas decompensated cirrhosis is a chronic and irreversible condition. TB peritonitis, pyogenic peritonitis, and neoplasm are unlikely causes of the yellow-colored ascetic fluid analysis and can be ruled out based on the patient's clinical presentation and history of alcohol abuse.",b,b,TRUE,

The boy's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a diagnosis of epididymo-orchitis, an infection of the epididymis and/or testicles. Antibiotics are the primary treatment for this condition, as it is usually caused by bacterial infection. Analgesia may provide temporary relief, but it does not treat the underlying infection. Reassurance is not appropriate, as there is a clear medical issue that needs to be addressed.

312. a 58yo lady presented with urinary incontinence. she looks anxious for her condition. urine culture is sterile. her urodynamic study is normal. what is the next step?,a. antibiotics,b. topical estrogen,c. systemic estrogen,d. duloxetine,e. pelvic floor exercise,,,,,,key: the key is e. pelvic floor exercise.,"The correct answer is e. Pelvic floor exercise. Antibiotics are not indicated as the urine culture is sterile and there is no evidence of infection. Topical or systemic estrogen may be appropriate for post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy, but the patient's symptoms are likely due to pelvic floor weakness and not related to hormonal changes. Duloxetine may improve symptoms by increasing urethral sphincter tone, but it is not the first-line treatment and may have side effects. Pelvic floor exercises can strengthen the muscles that control urination and are the most effective first-line treatment for urinary incontinence. It is important to educate the patient on performing the exercises correctly and to provide ongoing support and monitoring.",e,e,TRUE,
313. a 45yo lady came to family planning clinic for contraception advice. she is not keen to be pregnant for the next 3yrs. her recent us showed multiple small submucosal fibroid. what is the best method of contraception for her?,a. etonogestrol,b. cocp,c. ius,d. pop,e. iucd,,,,,,key: the key is c. ius. [ius gives 3-5 yrs long contraception. it also helps to shrink the fibroid].,"The correct answer is c. IUS. This is because the lady has fibroids, and the IUS (intrauterine system) not only provides long-term contraception (3-5 years), but it also helps to shrink the fibroid. The other options are not ideal for her situation. Etonogestrel and POP (progestin-only pill) are short-acting and may not provide effective contraception for the 3-year duration requested. COCP (combined oral contraceptive pill) may exacerbate her fibroid, and IUCD (intrauterine contraceptive device) may also cause heavy bleeding and pain due to the presence of fibroids. Therefore, the most suitable option for this patient is the IUS.",c,c,TRUE,
314. a child presents with eczema. she was given two creams by the gp – emollient and steroid. what advice would you give her regarding application of the cream?,a. sparingly use both the cream,"b. first use emollient, then steroid",c. apply steroid then emollient,d. mix emollient & steroid before use,e. emollient at night with steroid,,,,,,"key: the key is b. first use emollient, then steroid. [emmolient 30 minutes before steroid].","When a child has eczema and is given two creams, an emollient and a steroid cream, it is important to advise on the correct order of application. The correct answer is b, which is to first use the emollient and then the steroid cream. This is because the emollient helps to moisturize and hydrate the skin, preparing it to better absorb the steroid cream. It is also recommended to apply the emollient 30 minutes before the steroid cream to allow for proper absorption. Option a of using both creams sparingly could potentially lead to inadequate treatment of the eczema. Option c of applying steroid before emollient doesn't allow the emollient to fully hydrate the skin. Option d of mixing the creams before use could change the potency of the steroid. Option e of using emollient at night with steroid doesn't account for potential daytime symptoms. Therefore, advising the use of emollient before steroid cream, 30 minutes apart, is the correct approach to managing eczema.",b,b,TRUE,
315. all the following drugs do not cause bronchoconstriction except?,a. atenolol,b. salbutamol,c. salmetrol,d. ipratropium bromide,e. cocaine,,,,,,key: the key is a. atenolol.,"The correct answer is a. Atenolol. Atenolol does not cause bronchoconstriction, which is the narrowing of the airways in the lungs that can lead to difficulty breathing. The other answer choices, b. Salbutamol, c. Salmeterol, and d. Ipratropium bromide, are all bronchodilators, which means they relax the muscles in the airways to widen them and make breathing easier. Answer choice e. Cocaine is not a legitimate answer choice as it is not a medication. Therefore, it is important to know the mechanism of action of each medication to determine which one is the correct answer.",a,a,TRUE,
316. a 28 yo female who delivered 6 weeks ago feels sad and has no interest to feeding the baby. she has been eating poorly and having difficulty sleeping. she feels weak throughout the day and has stopped taking the baby out of the house. she also says that the baby has evil eyes. what is the most likely diagnosis?,a. postpartum blues,b. postpaetum depression,c. postpurtum psychosis,d. schizophrenia,e. psychotic depression,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is c. postpartum psychosis. key: 2. points in favour: i) features of depression: feels sad, poor eating, difficulty sleep, feeling weak ii) delusional ideas: thinks baby has evil eyes and not taking the baby out of the house. these points to postpartum psychosis. [postpartum psychosis starts within 2 wks (occasionally later) of delivery and it can take 6 -12 months or more to recover from postpartum psychosis].","Based on the given symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is postpartum psychosis, with the key being c. Postpartum psychosis typically starts within 2 weeks (occasionally later) of delivery and can take 6-12 months or more to fully recover from. The patient is exhibiting features of both depression, such as feeling sad, poor eating, difficulty sleeping, and feeling weak, and delusional ideas, such as thinking the baby has evil eyes and not taking the baby out of the house. Postpartum blues, postpartum depression, schizophrenia, and psychotic depression don't generally have such extreme symptoms as those demonstrated by the patient. Therefore, the most likely answer is c. postpartum psychosis.",c,c,TRUE,
317. a 44yo man presents with periorbital and pedal edema. 24h urine shows 8g of protein/d and serum cholesterol=7mmol/l. renal biopsy results are awaited. what would be the most likely dx?,a. minimal change disease,b. glomerulonephropathy,c. membranous glomerulonephropathy,d. fsgs,e. iga nephropathy,f. mesangiocapillary,,,,,key: the given key is c. membranous glomerulonephritis. this is wrong key. correct key is d. fsgs. [fsgs is most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults].,"Based on the patient's presentation with periorbital and pedal edema, high levels of proteinuria, and elevated serum cholesterol, the most likely diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome. The correct key for this question is d. FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis), which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Options a, b, c, e, and f are all types of glomerulonephropathy, but they are not as commonly associated with nephrotic syndrome as FSGS. Minimal change disease is more commonly seen in children, membranous glomerulonephropathy usually presents with lower levels of proteinuria, IgA nephropathy doesn't usually cause nephrotic syndrome, and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis is associated with nephritic syndrome rather than nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, FSGS is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.",c,c,TRUE,

The key presents several points in favor of this diagnosis, including weight loss, lethargy, abdominal discomfort, splenomegaly, and gout. Additionally, the blood picture is suggestive and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome is diagnostic. CLL (choice b) typically presents with lymphadenopathy and a lymphocytosis, whereas AML (choice c) often presents with anemia and thrombocytopenia. ALL (choice d) is more commonly seen in children, and lymphoma (choice e) usually presents with lymphadenopathy. Therefore, CML is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient’s presentation.",a,a,TRUE,

[rr= number of death in not treated group/number of death in treated group].,"The correct answer is e. The given key is e, which means that we are calculating the relative risk (RR) using the formula: RR= number of death in not treated group/number of death in treated group. In this scenario, 10 patients died in the non-treated group and 5 patients died in the treated group. Therefore, RR= 10/5= 2. This means that the risk of death is twice as high in the non-treated group compared to the treated group. Choice a is incorrect because it is referring to the absolute risk, which is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of patients. Choice b and c are both incorrect because they provide conflicting answers for the same calculation and the denominator should be the number of deaths in the treated group, not the non-treated group. Choice d is also incorrect because it is referring to the absolute risk in the treated group only. Overall, the correct answer is e because it accurately calculates the relative risk and provides a meaningful comparison between the two groups.",e,e,TRUE,
"320. a 67yo woman has presented with hard, irregular, poorly defined 5cm lump in her right breast. she has a bruise on the surface and there is no discharge. what is the most likely dx?",a. fibroadenosis,b. fat necrosis,c. fibroadenoma,d. duct ectasia,e. ca breast,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. fat necrosis. key: 2. fat necrosis usually occurs following trauma or surgery. given case is a fat necrosis of breast as there is no discharge and there is a bruise indicating prior trauma.,"The most likely diagnosis for this case is fat necrosis of the breast, which is characterized by the formation of lumps or nodules due to the death of adipose tissue. This is supported by the presence of a bruise on the surface, indicating prior trauma or injury, which is a common cause of fat necrosis. The absence of any discharge rules out duct ectasia, while fibroadenosis and fibroadenoma are more commonly associated with smooth, well-defined lumps. The final option of breast cancer cannot be ruled out entirely without further diagnostic testing, but it is less likely given the presented symptoms and patient demographic. Therefore, the correct answer is b, fat necrosis, while the other options are unlikely based on the given case details.",b,b,TRUE,
321. a 67yo female who had undergone a radical mastectomy now comes with the complaint of swelling and redness in her right upper limb. involvement of which of the following structures explain these symptoms?,a. epitrochlear ln,b. cephalic vein,c. subclavian artery,d. axillary group of ln,e. long thoracic nerve,,,,,,key: the key is d. axillary group of ln. [axillary clearance compromise lymphatic flow and may results in swelling of upper limb].,"The correct answer is d. The symptoms of swelling and redness in the right upper limb of a female who has undergone radical mastectomy can be best explained by the involvement of the axillary group of lymph nodes. This is because the axillary group of lymph nodes is responsible for draining lymphatic fluid from the upper limb. When lymphatic flow is compromised, as it is after a mastectomy, there is a risk of lymphedema, which can cause swelling, redness, and discomfort in the affected limb. The other choices are incorrect because they do not have a direct role in lymphatic drainage or flow. The epitrochlear lymph node is responsible for draining lymphatic fluid from the forearm and hand, the cephalic vein is a blood vessel, the subclavian artery is an arterial blood vessel, and the long thoracic nerve is not directly involved in lymphatic flow. Therefore, the correct answer is d.",d,d,TRUE,
322. a 50yo smoker and heavy drinker presents with complaints of racing heart. a 24h ecg comes out normal. what is your next step in management?,a. echo,b. reassure,c. stress test,,,,,,,,key: the key is b. reassure. [smoking and alcohol excess can cause palpitation without any recognizable arrhythmia and for this no treatment is required].,"In this scenario, the correct answer is b, reassure. Smoking and alcohol excess can often lead to palpitations without any identifiable arrhythmia, which means that no treatment would be required. An echocardiogram (answer a) or a stress test (answer c) would only be necessary if there were additional symptoms or indications of a potential heart condition. However, in this case, the 24-hour ECG came back normal, which suggests that the patient’s racing heart is likely related to their smoking and alcohol habits. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to reassure the patient that there is no serious cardiac condition present and to recommend lifestyle modifications to address their smoking and alcohol consumption.",b,b,TRUE,
323. a 47yo man comes to the gp with a swelling in his left groin which disappears on lying down. the swelling was bluish in color and felt like a bag of worms. he also complains of a mass in the left loin along with hematuria occasionally. what could be the possible dx?,a. left sided rcc,b. varicosity 2nd to liver disease,c. testicular tumor,d. uti,e. ivc obstruction,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is a. left sided renal cell carcinoma. key: 2. left sided varicocele. key: 3. most common secondary cause of left sided varicocele is rcc. newly diagnosed varicocele over the age of 40yrs are very much suggestive of rcc. varicocele is common on left side as left testicular veins drain to the left renal vein, while the right testicular vein drain directly into ivc.","The most probable diagnosis in this scenario is left sided renal cell carcinoma (RCC), based on the combination of symptoms presented. The patient has a swelling in left groin that disappears on lying down, which is a characteristic feature of left sided varicocele. Left sided varicocele is common because the left testicular veins drain into the left renal vein, which can be obstructed by a growing mass. Additionally, the patient complains of a mass in the left loin along with occasional hematuria, both of which are characteristic of RCC. Testicular tumor is less likely since the patient did not complain of any testicular symptoms, while UTI and IVC obstruction are not consistent with the described symptoms. Varicosity 2nd to liver disease is also not likely because the swelling is bluish in color and disappears on lying down, which are not typical features of liver disease. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is left sided RCC.",a,a,TRUE,
324. a man presents with muffled hearing and feeling of pressure in ear with tinnitus and vertigo. he also complains of double vision when looking to the right. what is the most appropriate dx?,a. meniere’s disease,b. acoustic neuroma,c. acute labyrinthytis,d. meningioma,e. otosclerosis,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is b. acoustic neuroma. key: 2. hearing loss, feeling of pressure in the ear with tinnitus, vertigo and involvement of cranial nerve i.e. right abducent nerve are suggestive of acoustic neuroma.","Based on the symptoms mentioned, the most appropriate diagnosis for this man would be acoustic neuroma (answer b). Acoustic neuroma is a type of tumor that develops on the nerves responsible for balance and hearing in the inner ear, which can cause hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), vertigo and a feeling of pressure in the ear. As it grows, it can also compress other nearby nerves, including the right abducent nerve which can result in double vision when looking to the right. Meniere's disease (answer a) is another inner ear disorder that can cause similar symptoms, but it typically includes additional symptoms such as a sensation of fullness in the ear, fluctuating hearing loss, and episodes of vertigo lasting several hours. Acute labyrinthitis (answer c) is a viral infection of the inner ear that causes sudden vertigo, but it usually doesn't result in hearing loss. Meningioma (answer d) is a type of brain tumor that can cause symptoms such as headaches and seizures, but typically doesn't cause symptoms specific to the ear. Otosclerosis (answer e) is a condition in which an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear can lead to hearing loss, but it doesn't typically cause vertigo or pressure sensation in the ear.",b,b,TRUE,
325. in 85% of the population this artery is dominant. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. left ant descending artery,b. coronary sinus,c. circumflex artery,"d. left main stem, post descending artery",e. right coronary artery,,,,,,key: 1. the key is e. right coronary artery. key: 2. if the posterior discending artery is supplied by the circumflex artery then it is left dominant and if posterior descending artery is supplied by the right coronary artery then it is right dominant. as in 85% of population posterior descending artery is supplied by right coronary artery it is called the dominant that is right coronary artery is dominant.,"The correct answer to the question is e. right coronary artery because in 85% of the population, the posterior descending artery is supplied by the right coronary artery, making it the dominant artery. This means that the right coronary artery is responsible for supplying blood to a larger area of the heart compared to other arteries. Choice a, left ant descending artery, and choice d, left main stem, post descending artery, are not correct as they are both left-sided arteries and not the dominant one. Choice b, coronary sinus, is also incorrect as it is not an artery but rather a vein that drains blood from the heart. Choice c, circumflex artery, might be left-dominant, supplying the posterior descending artery, but as mentioned earlier, the right coronary artery is responsible for this artery in the majority of individuals. Therefore, the single most appropriate option is e. right coronary artery because it is the most prominent and controls a larger area of the heart's blood supply.",e,e,TRUE,
"326. a 54 yo lady presents with sudden, severe pain in the left half of her skull. she also complains of pain around her jaw. what is the next likely step?",a. ct,b. mri,c. fundoscopy,d. esr,e. temporal artery biopsy,,,,,,key: 1. the key is esr. key: 2. the diagnosis is giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis. key: 3. points in favour: i) age >50yrs ii) female sex iii) severe pain in the left half of skull iv) pain around the jaw (jaw claudication).,"The correct answer is d. The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis, a condition that affects the temporal artery. The next step would be to perform an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test, as elevated levels are a strong indicator of the disease. Choice a and b, CT and MRI, are less helpful in diagnosing giant cell arteritis. Choice c, fundoscopy, can be useful in ruling out other conditions, but is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Choice e, temporal artery biopsy, is the gold standard for diagnosing the condition, but is a more invasive procedure that should only be performed after ESR levels have been found to be elevated.",d,d,TRUE,
327. a teenage girl who was ‘fine’ until her boyfriend said he didn’t want the relationship anymore. she took 10 tablets of paracetamol in front of his mother after taking alcohol. what should you do?,a. refer to psychiatry,b. counselling,c. gp to sort out family issues,d. return to work to relieve her anger,,,,,,,key: the key is a. refer to psychiatry. [1o tablets of paracetamol is not a life threatening toxic dose and simultaneous drug overdose and alcohol consumption needs psychiatric evaluation].,"In the case of a teenage girl who took 10 tablets of paracetamol in front of her boyfriend's mother after consuming alcohol following the dissolution of a relationship, the correct answer is A – referral to psychiatry. This is because taking 10 tablets of paracetamol is not a life-threatening toxic dose, but the fact that it was taken simultaneously with alcohol consumption and in the context of emotional distress indicates the need for psychiatric evaluation. Counselling or sorting out family issues with a GP may be beneficial, but they do not address the immediate need for psychiatric evaluation and management of the potential risks of suicide. Returning to work to relieve anger is also not a suitable option in this scenario. Overall, proper diagnosis and management of the underlying psychiatric and emotional issues is essential in such cases.",a,a,TRUE,
328. a 6yo fell on outstretched hand while playing. he feels tender at the elbow but otherwise well. what is the most likely dx?,a. spiral fx,b. green stick fx,c. compound fx,d. supracondylar fx,e. pulled elbow,,,,,,key: the key is b. green stick fracture.,"The correct answer to this question is b. green stick fracture. A green stick fracture is a type of fracture that occurs when one side of a long bone is broken while the other side is bent, causing a partial break in the bone. This is most commonly seen in children due to their more flexible bones. In this case, the 6-year-old fell on their outstretched hand, which could have caused a green stick fracture in their elbow. The other choices, such as spiral, compound, supracondylar, and pulled elbow are less likely as they usually involve more severe traumas that may cause dislocations, deformities, and/or significant pain that could not be overlooked. Therefore, based on the symptoms provided, a green stick fracture is the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
"329. a man has a bp of 160/90mmhg, proteinuria++. kub us are equally reduced in size with smooth borders and normal pelvic calyceal system. what is the cause of htn in the pt?",a. chronic glomerulonephritis,b. chronic pyelonephritis,c. bilateral renal artery stenosis,d. essential htn,e. polycystic kidney,,,,,,key: the key is bilateral renal artery stenosis. this is probably a wrong key. the correct key should be a. chronic glomerulonephritis. [in bilateral renal artery stenosis bp is very high (much more than 160/90 mmhg].,"Based on the given clinical manifestations, the most probable cause of hypertension in the patient is chronic glomerulonephritis (GN). The presence of proteinuria++ suggests that the kidneys are not functioning properly, and glomeruli are most commonly affected in chronic GN. The evenly reduced size of kidneys and normal pelvic calyceal system on KUB US also support this diagnosis, as chronic GN is associated with a diffuse, symmetric reduction in kidney size. Bilateral renal artery stenosis can also cause hypertension, but usually, the blood pressure is much higher than in this case. Essential hypertension is a diagnosis of exclusion and cannot be established until other causes of hypertension have been ruled out. Chronic pyelonephritis and polycystic kidney disease are not likely in this scenario, as KUB US findings are inconsistent with these diagnoses. In summary, chronic GN is the most probable diagnosis in the given case, underlying the cause of hypertension and proteinuria.",a,a,TRUE,
"330. a lady presents with abdominal pain, dysuria, dyspareunia and vaginal discharge. what si your next step?",a. laparoscopy,b. high vaginal swab,c. hysteroscopy,d. laparotomy,e. us,,,,,,key: the key is b. high vaginal swab. [probable diagnosis is pid].,"The correct answer is b) high vaginal swab. This is because the symptoms the patient is presenting with are indicative of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is often caused by bacterial infection in the reproductive tract. A high vaginal swab will allow for the collection of a sample of vaginal discharge, which can be tested for bacterial infection. This can help in identifying the cause of the patient’s symptoms and guide appropriate treatment. The other options such as laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, laparotomy, and ultrasound are not the appropriate next step for diagnosis of PID and may only be considered if there are complications or if the patient does not respond to initial treatment.",b,b,TRUE,

[probable impacted food bolus (usually meat)which can be visualized and removed with the aid of endoscopy].,"The correct answer to the question is option C, endoscopy. This is because an old lady of 72 years, who is a known hypertensive and residing in a nursing home for some years, suddenly presents with dysphagia while eating with drooling of saliva, which could be indicative of an impacted food bolus, commonly meat. The use of endoscopy aids in the visualization and removal of the food bolus, making it the most appropriate and urgent intervention required in this situation. Options A, B, D, E, and F are incorrect as they are not the most appropriate intervention for the presented scenario. A chest CT, CXR, and laryngoscopy may not provide the necessary visualization required for diagnosis and treatment, while endoscopy with biopsy would not be prioritized over the urgent need to visualize and remove the impacted food bolus.",c,c,TRUE,
332. a man presents with outward deviation of his right eye and diplopia. which nerve is affected?,a. left trochlear,b. left oculomotor,c. right trochlear,d. right abducens,e. right oculomotor,,,,,,key: the given key is b. left oculomotor! it is wrong key! answer should be e. right oculomotor.,"The correct answer is e. right oculomotor. This is because the patient is presenting with outward deviation of their right eye, which suggests a muscle weakness in the medial rectus muscle of the right eye. The oculomotor nerve controls this muscle, along with several others involved in eye movement and pupil contraction. The other choices are incorrect because they do not innervate the affected muscle or are located on the opposite side of the body. The left trochlear nerve controls the superior oblique muscle, which is not affected in this case. The left oculomotor nerve is on the opposite side of the body and does not innervate the affected muscle. The right trochlear nerve controls the superior oblique muscle, which is also not affected in this case. The right abducens nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is not responsible for the outward deviation seen in this patient.",e,e,TRUE,
333. a 60yo pt who has had a mi a week back presents with dyspnea and pericardial rub. ecg shows st elevation. cxr: loss of margin at costo-vertebral angle. what is the single most likely cause?,a. cardiac tamponade,b. mitral regurge,c. dressler’s syndrome,d. atrial fib,e. emboli,,,,,,key: 1. the key is c. dressler’s syndrome. key: 2. there is pericardial rub there is pericarditis and in pericarditis there is widespread st elevation. so the condition is not new mi but dressler’s syndrome.,"The most likely cause for this patient's symptoms is Dressler's syndrome (Option C). The presence of pericardial rub, widespread ST elevation on ECG, and loss of margin at the costo-vertebral angle on CXR are consistent with this diagnosis. This syndrome is a type of pericarditis that occurs after a myocardial infarction and can present weeks to months after the initial event. Cardiac tamponade (Option A) could cause similar symptoms, but it typically presents more acutely rather than a week after MI. Mitral regurgitation (Option B) and emboli (Option E) may cause dyspnea, but they do not explain the pericardial rub or ST elevation on ECG. Atrial fibrillation (Option D) may also cause dyspnea but would not explain the pericardial rub or loss of margin on CXR. Therefore, Dressler's syndrome is the most likely cause in this patient.",c,c,TRUE,
"334. a 12yo girl presented with tics, loc, no residual sign and no post-ictal phase. eeg abnormality in temporal lobe. the girl had a rapid recovery. what is the most probably dx?",a. generalized tonic-clonic,b. myoclonic,c. partialgeneralized seizure,d. atonic seizure,e. febrile convulsion,,,,,,key: the key is c. partial –> generalized seizure,"The correct answer is c, partial to generalized seizure. This is because the patient presented with tics and lost consciousness without any residual signs or post-ictal phase, which suggests a partial seizure. However, the abnormality in the temporal lobe indicates that the seizure spread to become generalized, as the temporal lobe is one of the most common areas for seizures to begin and spread from. Option a, generalized tonic-clonic, is not fully accurate as the presentation did not include the typical convulsions associated with this type of seizure. Option b, myoclonic, is unlikely as the description did not mention any sudden jerking movements. Option d, atonic seizure, is not likely either since the patient did not have a loss of muscle tone. Lastly, option e, febrile convulsion, is not likely either since there is no indication of fever being present. Therefore, option c is the most probable diagnosis based on the presentation and EEG findings.",c,c,TRUE,
335. a 48yo woman who has been taking medications for asthma for a long time has now presented with decreasing vision. what is the most probable cause for her decrease in vision?,a. inhaled salbutamol,b. inhaled steroids,c. aminophylline,d. beta-blockers,e. oral steroids,,,,,,key: 1. the key is e. oral steroid. key: 2. prolonged steroid use leads to cataract formation.,"The most probable cause for the woman's decrease in vision would be the oral steroids she has been taking for her asthma. Prolonged use of steroids, as mentioned in key 2, can lead to cataract formation. Therefore, it is important to consider this potential side effect when prescribing steroids for extended periods of time. The other choices, inhaled salbutamol, inhaled steroids, aminophylline, and beta-blockers, are unlikely to cause a decrease in vision as they do not have this listed as a common side effect. Overall, it is important to weigh the potential risks and benefits of any medication before prescribing them to patients and to monitor for any adverse effects, including vision changes.",e,e,TRUE,
336. a 34yo man after a car crash is in the ed and deteriorating. his gcs has fallen from 13 to 7. what is the most appropriate next step?,a. ct,b. burr hole,c. mri,d. intubation,e. iv fluids,,,,,,key: the key is d. intubation. [abc protocol].,"The correct answer is d. intubation. The patient's decreased level of consciousness and deteriorating condition suggest that he may need immediate help with breathing. Intubation, therefore, is the most appropriate next step as it provides a secure airway and ensures adequate oxygenation. CT and MRI scans may be helpful in determining the extent of the patient's injuries, but they are not the most urgent priority in this situation. Burr hole, on the other hand, involves creating a hole in the skull to relieve pressure on the brain and is not necessary in this scenario. IV fluids may be helpful but addressing the patient's airway takes priority.",d,d,TRUE,
337. a pt with alternating swings or episodes from elation and depression had underwent tx and gotten better. what medication needed to be continued so he can stay well?,a. anxiolytics,b. mood stabilizers,c. antidepressants,d. antipsychotics,,,,,,,key: the key is b. mood stabilizers [bipolar disorder treated with mood stabilizers].,"The correct answer to this question is b. Mood stabilizers. This medication is necessary for the patient to maintain their well-being because it helps to regulate the extreme mood swings that are commonly experienced in bipolar disorder. Anxiolytics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics are not appropriate choices because they do not specifically address the fluctuations in mood that are characteristic of bipolar disorder. Anxiolytics are typically used to treat anxiety, antidepressants to alleviate symptoms of depression, and antipsychotics to manage psychotic symptoms. However, these medications alone are not effective in treating bipolar disorder and may even worsen the patient's symptoms.

While calcium gluconate does not significantly reduce serum potassium levels, it is known to prevent life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, which provides time to implement definitive measures such as hemodialysis. Options A, B, C, and D are not appropriate management strategies in this scenario. Option A - calcium supplement - is not specific enough to address the acute issue at hand. Option B - calcium resonate enema 30g - is not shown to be effective in reducing serum potassium levels or preventing cardiac arrhythmias. Option C - 10 units insulin with 50% dextrose - is a potential treatment option for hyperkalemia, but the patient's serum potassium level is extremely high, and this treatment alone will not be sufficient. Option D - nebulized salbutamol - can lower serum potassium levels, but is not effective in preventing the dangerous cardiac arrhythmias seen in this scenario. Ultimately, hemodialysis is the definitive management strategy for this patient, but options such as option E - administering calcium gluconate - should be implemented first to prevent any life-threatening complications while preparing for dialysis.",e,e,TRUE,

The patient's low blood pressure and rapid respiratory rate indicate a serious injury that requires immediate intervention to maintain adequate oxygenation and blood flow. IV fluid infusion [answer choice A] may be necessary following intubation, but it is not the primary intervention needed in this situation. CT chest [answer choice C] is a diagnostic tool that may be used later, but it is not an initial action. Transfer to ITU [answer choice D] may be necessary after intubation, but it is not the first intervention required to stabilize the patient's condition. Therefore, performing intubation and ventilation as the initial action is crucial in this emergency situation.",b,b,TRUE,

[asthma may be associated with atopy].,"The correct answer is b. eczema. This is because the patient displays symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and nocturnal waking, which are common in individuals with atopic disorders. Additionally, the skin condition present in the patient is dry and scaly, with itchy rashes, which are consistent with eczema. Scabies is unlikely as it typically results in a different kind of skin rash, while rheumatism and psoriasis do not have a direct association with the symptoms described. Dermatitis may also be a possible answer but eczema is the most likely diagnosis as these two conditions share similar symptoms and characteristics.",b,b,TRUE,

[ with addison disease, the sodium, chloride, and carbon dioxide levels are often low, while the potassium level is high].","In a patient with Addison's disease, the most likely electrolyte abnormality expected is low sodium, high potassium levels, making option b the correct answer. This is due to the insufficient production of hormones by the adrenal glands, which leads to a decrease in aldosterone, a hormone responsible for retaining sodium and regulating potassium excretion. As a result, the patient experiences episodes of vomiting, abdominal ache, and postural hypotension. The other options are incorrect because high sodium levels are unlikely due to the low aldosterone production while low sodium levels, low potassium levels, and high sodium levels are unlikely with this condition.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient's presentation of pus in the auditory canal and severe pain is typical of a diagnosis of otitis externa, which is an infection of the outer ear canal. Gentamicin topical is the preferred treatment option for otitis externa infections because it directly targets the bacteria causing the infection, which is often Staphylococcus aureus. Amoxicillin PO and IV would not be effective in treating otitis externa because they are systemic antibiotics that do not readily penetrate the ear canal. Analgesia may provide symptomatic relief, but it will not address the underlying infection. Therefore, gentamicin topical is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient's presentation.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because resuscitation is mostly done with 0.9% NS, which contains isotonic sodium chloride and is used to restore blood volume and correct dehydration. Options A, D, and E all contain varying percentages of dextrose and/or potassium chloride, which are not necessary for initial resuscitation in this case. Option C, 0.45% NS, is hypotonic and could cause hyponatremia and cerebral edema in this critically ill child.

The carotid arteries supply blood to the brain and when they become narrowed or blocked, it can result in reduced blood flow to the brain. This can cause symptoms such as LOC and TIA, which can be a warning sign for stroke. Atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) can also cause reduced blood flow to the brain, but carotid artery stenosis is the most likely cause in this case.",e,e,TRUE,

[infection is a common cause of secondary haemorrhage. patient should be admitted to observe the course of bleeding and treatment is given with iv antibiotics].,"In the case of a patient presenting with hemoptysis 7 days post-tonsillectomy, the correct next step would be to admit them and administer IV antibiotics, as infection is a common cause of secondary hemorrhage. By admitting them, the course of the bleeding could be observed while providing appropriate treatment with IV antibiotics. The other answer choices are incorrect for various reasons. Choice A, packing, may only provide temporary relief and does not address the cause of bleeding. Choice B, oral antibiotics and discharge, may not be sufficient to treat the underlying infection and prevent further bleeding. Choice D, returning to the theatre and exploring, may be too invasive and potentially harmful to the patient. Choice E, ice cream and cold fluids, is not a medically appropriate or effective treatment for hemoptysis. Therefore, option C, admit and administer IV antibiotics, is the best course of action.",c,c,TRUE,

[probable intracranial haemorrhage].,"The correct answer is d. CT brain. The decrease in GCS could be a sign of an underlying intracranial hemorrhage, which should be confirmed by a CT scan of the brain. Referring the child to a neuro-surgeon without confirming the diagnosis is premature, and IV fluids and oxygen may be helpful, but they do not address the potential intracranial hemorrhage. Skull x-ray is also not an appropriate diagnostic tool for intracranial injury. Therefore, CT brain is the best option to investigate the cause of the decrease in GCS and to guide appropriate management.",d,d,TRUE,
"347. a 57yo woman who is suffering from htn, presented to the hospital with complaints of recurrent falls when trying to get out of bed or getting up from sitting. she is on some anti-htn therapy with no other med prbs. what is the cause of her fall?",a. ccb,b. vertibrobasiliar insufficiency,c. thiazide,d. hypoglycemia,e. infection,,,,,,key: the key is c. thiazide. [it causes postural hypotension by volume depletion].,"The correct answer is c, thiazide. Thiazide is a type of diuretic medication used to treat hypertension. It works by reducing the volume of the blood, which in turn can cause postural hypotension, a condition where the blood pressure drops suddenly when standing up, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, and falls. This is the most likely cause of the recurrent falls in the 57-year-old woman with hypertension. 
The other choices are unlikely to be the cause of the falls: a) CCB (calcium channel blocker) is another class of antihypertensive medication, but it does not typically cause postural hypotension; b) vertebrobasilar insufficiency is usually associated with symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and imbalance, but not necessarily falls; d) hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can be a cause of falls, but it is not seen in this case as the patient has no other medical problems; e) infection is also not a likely cause of falls. In summary, the most likely cause of the recurrent falls in this patient is postural hypotension from thiazide medication.",c,c,TRUE,

The features of the 5th, 7th, and 8th cranial nerves being involved along with cerebellum involvement strongly suggest a brain stem lesion. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination of movements and would not explain the other symptoms mentioned. The cerebrum is responsible for higher brain functions such as thinking and consciousness and would not cause facial drooping or hearing impairment. The spinal cord controls the body's movements below the neck and would not affect the face or hearing. The optic nerve is responsible for vision and has nothing to do with the present symptoms mentioned. Therefore, key d, brain stem, is the most likely answer.",d,d,TRUE,

Pleomorphic adenomas are slow-growing and asymptomatic, but have malignant potentiality. Adenolymphoma, mikulicz’s disease, parotiditis, and frey’s syndrome are less likely as they do not match the presenting symptoms and are not the most common tumor of the parotid gland. Thus, a pleomorphic adenoma is the most probable diagnosis for the patient’s condition.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient is a smoker and presents with a loss of posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulsation, along with a non-healing ulcer at the base of the right 1st mtp joint. These symptoms are consistent with the clinical presentation of Buerger's Disease, which is a rare autoimmune condition that affects the small and medium-sized arteries, veins, and nerves of the upper and lower limbs.

[genital herpes may be asymptomatic or may remain dormant for months or even years. when symptoms occur soon after a person is infected, they tend to be severe. they may start as multiple small blisters that eventually break open and produce raw, painful sores that scab and heal over within a few weeks. the blisters and sores may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms with fever and swollen lymph nodes. there are three major drugs commonly used to  treat genital herpes symptoms:  acyclovir (zovirax), famciclovir (famvir), and valacyclovir(valtrex). these are all taken in pill form. severe cases may be treated with the intravenous (iv) drug acyclovir].","The correct answer to this question is a. Anti-HSV antibodies. Genital herpes can present as painful ulcers on the vulva, which can be diagnosed by testing for anti-HSV antibodies. The other choices are not appropriate for diagnosing genital herpes. Dark ground microscopy of the ulcer is used to diagnose syphilis, while treponema palladium antibody and rapid plasma regain tests are also used for syphilis diagnosis. VDRL is a blood test that also detects syphilis. Therefore, it is crucial to choose the most appropriate test to ensure the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.",a,a,TRUE,

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of skin cancer that arises in squamous cells. SCCs can occur on all areas of the body, including the mucous membranes and genitals, but are most common in areas frequently exposed to the sun. Symptoms include scaly red patches, open sores, elevated growths with a central depression, or warts that may crust and bleed. In this case, the lesion on the man's arm has started bleeding on touch, which is a common symptom of SCCs. Basal cell carcinoma is also a type of skin cancer, but it typically presents as a pearly, translucent bump with visible blood vessels and rarely bleeds. Kaposi's sarcoma and malignant melanoma are not likely diagnoses in this case because they typically present differently and are less likely to bleed. Keratoacanthoma is a benign tumor that may resemble SCC but is less likely to bleed and typically resolves on its own without treatment. Therefore, the correct answer is D, squamous cell carcinoma.",d,d,TRUE,

[in dilated cardiomyopathy ejection fraction is decreased (but here increased which goes in favour of constrictive pericarditis). on the other hand decreased septal wall thickness favours the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. so it seems to be a bad recall!!].,"Based on the information you provided, it seems that the most likely diagnosis for a 47-year-old man with a history of ischemic heart disease (IHD) who complains of chest pain with shortness of breath (SOB) on exertion over the past few days, with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram (echo) showing increased ejection fraction (EF) and decreased septal wall thickness, is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a rare disease characterized by the buildup of amyloid proteins in organs and tissues, which can affect their normal function. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including heart problems such as cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias.  Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood effectively. The symptoms of DCM can include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and feet. However, in the case you described, the echocardiogram showed an increased ejection fraction and decreased septal wall thickness, which are not typical findings in DCM.
Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart, becomes thickened and scarred, restricting the heart s ability to expand and fill with blood. The symptoms of constrictive pericarditis can include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and feet. However, in the case you described, the echocardiogram showed an increased ejection fraction, which is not a typical finding in constrictive pericarditis.
Subacute endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. The symptoms of subacute endocarditis can include fever, chills, fatigue, and a new or changed heart murmur. However, in the case you described, there was no mention of fever or other signs of infection.",a,c,corrected,

This is because these symptoms are commonly associated with hypoglycemia, which is a common complication of diabetes that can be effectively treated by raising the patient's blood sugar levels. An ECG (option b) would not be necessary in this case as there are no reported cardiovascular symptoms, and standing and lying blood pressure (option c) would not be helpful in further management of these particular symptoms. A fasting blood sugar (option d) may be helpful to determine long-term blood sugar control, but would not address the immediate symptoms presented by the patient. CT scans (option e) would likely not be necessary in this case unless there was a suspected underlying neurological issue causing the patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the ultrasound shows the absence of a gastric bubble which suggests that there is a blockage in the digestive system. Esophageal atresia is a condition where the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, does not form properly and therefore food cannot pass through to the stomach. This can lead to a buildup of amniotic fluid in the baby's digestive system which can cause polyhydramnios, or excess amniotic fluid. The other choices, duodenal atresia, gastrochiasis, exomphalos, and diaphragmatic hernia, all involve different abnormalities in the digestive system but do not directly affect the esophagus, making them less likely diagnoses in this case.",b,b,TRUE,

The likelihood of hemodynamic instability is high, which is indicated by the cool peripheries due to low blood pressure or inadequate cardiac output (key 2). Considering the regular narrow complex tachycardia and the difficulty in identifying the P wave, the probable diagnosis is supraventricular tachycardia (key 3). Administering a fluid bolus (option A) may not be the optimal choice as it would further overload the enlarged heart, leading to increasing congestion and possibly worsening the situation. Administering Oxygen (option B) may be helpful but does not address the underlying arrhythmia itself. Oral beta-blockers (option C) can be effective in the long-term management of supraventricular tachycardia, but they are not appropriate for the immediate treatment of hemodynamically unstable patients. Unilateral carotid sinus massage (option E) may be effective in terminating the arrhythmia in adults with a known history of carotid hypersensitivity, but it is not recommended for newly diagnosed infants with high ventricular rates. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate treatment for this patient is synchronized DC cardioversion, which can promptly and effectively restore the normal rhythm.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because of the key information provided: ""unexplained liver disease with respiratory symptoms are very suggestive of aatd."" Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that causes reduced levels of a protein called alpha 1 antitrypsin, which protects the lungs and liver from damage. Symptoms can include chronic cough, jaundice, and liver disease. The other choices listed, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, bronchiolitis, and respiratory distress syndrome, do not fit with the key information provided and are not associated with the presentation described in the question.

An indirect inguinal hernia is caused by the protrusion of a tissue or organ through the deep inguinal ring, which is located within the transversalis fascia of the abdominal wall. This type of hernia originated from the abdominal cavity and passed through the deep inguinal ring, then the inguinal canal, and finally exited through the superficial inguinal ring. The incorrect options are (a) passes through the superficial inguinal ring only, which is incorrect as the indirect hernia passes through both the deep and superficial inguinal rings, (b) lies above and lateral to the pubic tubercle, which is incorrect as this describes the position of a direct inguinal hernia, and (c) does not pass through the superficial inguinal ring, which is incorrect as the indirect inguinal hernia exits the inguinal canal through the superficial inguinal ring.",d,d,TRUE,

The ulcers on the vulva indicate the presence of genital herpes, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Chlamydia, trichomonas, and gardenella are all sexually transmitted infections that can cause symptoms such as discharge, pain, and itching, but they do not typically cause ulcers in the genital area. EBV, or Epstein-Barr virus, is not a sexually transmitted infection and would not be a likely cause of genital ulcers. Therefore, the key to identifying the cause of this woman's symptoms is recognizing the characteristic presentation of genital herpes.",d,d,TRUE,
360. a 72 yo man has been on warfarin for 2yrs because of past tia and stroke. what is the most important complication that we should be careful with?,a. headache,b. osteoporosis,c. ear infection,d. limb ischemia,e. diarrhea,,,,,,key: the given key is e. diarrhoea which is considered as a wrong key and a. headache is the correct key. [headache is the warning sign of hemorrhagic stroke].,"The correct answer to the question is a) headache, as it is a warning sign of hemorrhagic stroke. While warfarin can help prevent another stroke, it can also increase the risk of bleeding. This puts the patient at a higher risk of developing a hemorrhagic stroke, which is a type of stroke caused by bleeding in the brain. Headache is a common symptom of this type of stroke, and therefore, it is important to monitor for any headaches that may indicate a potentially life-threatening complication. Osteoporosis, ear infection, limb ischemia, and diarrhea are not related to the use of warfarin or stroke risk, and therefore, are not the most important complications to be careful with in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because undergoing surgery within just 2 months after a myocardial infarction (mi) has been associated with a higher mortality rate. The other options, namely a. controlled asthma, b. controlled atrial fibrillation, c. DVT 2 years ago, and d. diastolic blood pressure 90mmHg, do not necessarily require the delay of the surgery as long as they are managed and controlled adequately. It is important to delay the surgery until the patient has fully recovered and is stable enough to undergo the operation safely.",e,e,TRUE,

[pneumonia should be treated first].,"The correct answer is c. IV antibiotics. The presence of basal consolidation in the left lung indicates the patient may have pneumonia which needs to be treated first. The patient's history of liver cancer and osteoporosis should also be taken into consideration while making a treatment decision. Therefore, option a, PPI IV, may provide relief for gastric reflux and bloatedness, but it does not address the primary concern of pneumonia. Option b, alendronate, is not appropriate for treating pneumonia. Option d, analgesic, may provide pain relief but does not address the root cause of the patient's symptoms. Lastly, option e, PPI PO, may not be as effective as the IV form and does not address the primary concern of pneumonia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to administer IV antibiotics to treat the pneumonia first in order to prevent further complications.",c,c,TRUE,

[p waves are replaced by fibrillatory f-waves. irregular r-r intervals. dx atrial fibrillation].,"The correct answer is a. Metoprolol. The ECG shows that the patient has atrial fibrillation, which is characterized by F-waves replacing P-waves and irregular RR intervals. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can help control the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. Option b, digoxin, is not the best choice as it primarily slows down the conduction through the AV node, whereas controlling the heart rate through beta-blockers is the current standard of care. Carotid sinus massage (c) is not appropriate as it can cause significant reductions in blood pressure and trigger arrhythmias, and should be performed only by experienced personnel. Adenosine (d) is used for the management of supraventricular tachycardia but can lead to dangerous hypotension in patients with atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone (e) is an anti-arrhythmic drug that can be used for rate and rhythm control in patients with recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, but its use is usually reserved for cases that are refractory to beta-blockers. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to initiate metoprolol to control the heart rate.",a,a,TRUE,
364. a 22yo sexually active male came with 2d hx of fever with pain in scrotal area. exam: scrotal skin is red and tender. what is the most appropriate dx?,a. torsion of testis,b. orchitis,c. inguinal hernia,d. epididymo-orchitis,,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is d. epididymo-orchitis. ans 2. in epididymo-orchitis there should be fever, elevation of testes reduces pain (positive prehn sign), in torsion testis lies at a higher level. in torsion urinalysis negative but in epididymo-orchitis it is positive. epididymo-orchitis usually occurs in sexually active man.","The most appropriate diagnosis in this case is d. epididymo-orchitis. This is because the patient is a sexually active male with a two-day history of fever and pain in the scrotal area. On examination, the scrotal skin is red and tender. In epididymo-orchitis, patients often have a positive Prehn sign where elevation of the testes reduces pain whereas in torsion of testis, the testis lies at a higher level. Furthermore, in torsion, urinalysis is negative whereas in epididymo-orchitis it is positive. Orchitis and inguinal hernia may also present with scrotal pain, but in this case, the history and physical examination findings are consistent with epididymo-orchitis.",d,d,TRUE,
365. a man on warfarin posted for hemicolectomy. as the pt is about to undergo surgery. what option is the best for him?,a. continue with warfarin,b. continue with warfarin and add heparin,c. stop warfarin and add aspirin,d. stop warfarin and add heparin,e. stop warfarin,,,,,,key: the key is d. stop warfarin and add heparin.,"The correct answer is d, to stop warfarin and add heparin. This is because warfarin acts as a blood thinner, which can cause excessive bleeding during surgery. Heparin, on the other hand, works quickly to prevent blood clots and can be reversed if needed. Continuing with warfarin, either alone or with the addition of heparin or aspirin, would put the patient at risk for complications during the surgery. Aspirin also acts as a blood thinner and should be avoided in this situation. Finally, choosing to stop warfarin but not replace it with another anticoagulant would also put the patient at risk for blood clots. Therefore, stopping warfarin and adding heparin is the best option for this patient.",d,d,TRUE,
"366. a 65yo known alcoholic is brought into hospital with confusion, aggressiveness and ophthalmoplegia. he is treated with diazepoxide. what other drug would you like to prescribe?",a. antibiotics,b. glucose,c. iv fluids,d. disulfiram,e. vit b complex,,,,,,key: the key is e. vitamin b complex.,"The correct answer is e - vitamin B complex. The patient is exhibiting symptoms of Wernicke’s encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine deficiency often seen in alcoholics. The administration of diazepoxide can worsen thiamine deficiency. Therefore, it is important to also prescribe vitamin B complex to prevent further neurological damage. Antibiotics, glucose, and IV fluids are not indicated for Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Disulfiram is used for alcohol aversion therapy but is contraindicated in acute alcohol withdrawal.",e,e,TRUE,
367. a 32yo woman has severe right sided abdominal pain radiating into the groin which has lasted for 3h. she is writhering in pain. she has no abdominal signs. what is the most likely cause of her abdominal pain?,a. appendicitis,b. ruptured ectopic pregnancy,c. salpingitis,d. ureteric colic,e. strangulated hernia,,,,,,key: 1. the key is d. ureteric colic. key: 2. it indicate stone at lower ureter. [i) pain from upper ureteral stones tends to radiate to the flank and lumbar areas. ii) midureteral calculi cause pain that radiates anteriorly and caudally. this midureteral pain in particular can easily mimic appendicitis on the right or acute diverticulitis on the left. iii) distal ureteral stones cause pain that tends to radiate into the groin or testicle in the male or labia majora in the female.,"The correct answer for this question is d. ureteric colic. The severe right-sided abdominal pain radiating into the groin along with the absence of abdominal signs is indicative of a stone at the lower ureter. The pain caused by distal ureteral stones, in particular, tends to radiate to the groin or testicle in males or labia majora in females which matches the patient's symptoms. Choices a, b, and c are less likely as they do not generally present with the symptoms mentioned by the patient. Choice e is also unlikely as it would present with visible signs of obstruction, which are not mentioned in the case. Therefore, the most likely cause of the abdominal pain is ureteric colic caused by a stone at the lower ureter.",d,d,TRUE,
"368. a 39yo coal miner who smokes, drinks and has a fam hx of bladder cancer is suffering from bph. the most important risk factor for his bladder carcinoma is?",a. fam hx,b. smoking,c. exposure to coal mine,d. bph,,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is b. smoking. key: 2. risk factors of bladder cancer: i) smoking ii) exposure to chemicals used in dye industry iii) whites are more likely to develop bladder cancer iv) risk increases with age v) more common in men vi) chronic bladder irritation and infections (urinary infections, kidney and bladder stones, bladder catheter left in place a long time.) vii) personal history of bladder or other urothelial cancer viii) family history ix) chemotherapy or radiotherapy x) pioglitazone for more than one year and certain herb xi) arsenic in drinking water xii) low fluid consumption.","The correct answer is b, smoking. Smoking is a well-established risk factor for bladder cancer and the individual in the scenario is a smoker. Although a family history of bladder cancer may increase the risk, it is not the most important risk factor in this case. Exposure to coal mine may increase the risk of lung cancer, but there is no clear association with bladder cancer. BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) is a common condition in men and is not directly linked to bladder cancer. Therefore, smoking remains the most important risk factor for bladder carcinoma in this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,
"369. a 34yo woman is referred to the endocrine clinic with a hx of thyrotoxicosis. at her 1st appointment she is found to have a smooth goiter, lid lag and bilateral exophthalmos with puffy eyelids and conjunctival injection. she wants to discuss the tx of her thyroid prb as she is keen to become pregnant. what is the most likely tx you would advise?",a. 18m of carbimazole alone,b. 18m of ptu (propylthyouracil) alone,c. a combo od anti-thyroid drug an0d thyroxine,d. radioactive iodine,e. thyroidectomy,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is b. 18m of ptu alone.  key: 2. other drug option i.e carbimazole is teratogenic [can cause i) spina bifida ii) cardiovascular malformations, hypospadius etc] if become pregnant. ptu is on the other hand relatively safe in pregnancy.","Based on the patient's desire to become pregnant and the potential risks associated with teratogenicity, the most likely treatment option to advise would be 18 months of PTU alone (answer choice B). This is because carbimazole is known to cause birth defects such as spina bifida and cardiovascular malformations if taken during pregnancy, while PTU is considered relatively safe. Additionally, the patient's presentation of a smooth goiter, lid lag, and bilateral exophthalmos with puffy eyelids and conjunctival injection is suggestive of Graves' disease, which is a primary indication for anti-thyroid drugs such as PTU. The other answer choices are less appropriate for this patient's specific circumstances, as a combination of anti-thyroid drugs and thyroxine could lead to overcorrection and potential fetal harm, radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy, and thyroidectomy is generally reserved for cases that are refractory to medical treatment.",b,b,TRUE,
"370. a child living with his stepfather is brought by the mother with multiple bruises, fever and fractures. what do you suspect?",a. nai,b. malnutrition,c. thrombocytopenia,d. hiv,,,,,,,"key: the key is a. nai. [h/o living with stepfather, multiple bruises, fever and fractures are suggestive of nai].","Based on the presented information, the most probable answer for this question is a, nai. Nai or non-accidental injury is a term commonly used to refer to child abuse. The multiple bruises, fever, and fractures that the child has are highly suggestive of this suspicion. The fact that the child is living with a stepfather could also add to the suspicion of nai. However, the other options, b, malnutrition, c, thrombocytopenia, and d, HIV, are unlikely causes of the child's symptoms. It's important to note that a proper medical evaluation and investigation will be required to arrive at a final diagnosis. But based on the limited information provided, a is the most probable answer.",a,a,TRUE,
371. a young man who was held by the police was punched while in custody. he is now cyanosed and unresponsive. what is the 1st thing you would do?,a. iv fluids,b. clear airway,c. turn pt and put in recovery position,d. give 100% oxygen,e. intubate and ventilate,,,,,,key: the key is b. clear airway. [abc protocol].,"The correct answer to this question is b. clear airway. When a patient is unresponsive and cyanosed, it indicates that they are not getting enough oxygen. Therefore, the priority should be to open up their airway and ensure that they are able to breathe properly. This can be done by tilting the head back and lifting the chin, or by using other airway management techniques such as suctioning or inserting an oropharyngeal airway. 

Choice a, IV fluids, is not the correct answer as it does not address the immediate need to provide oxygen to the patient. Choice c, turning the patient into the recovery position, may be appropriate once the airway is secured, but it is not the first priority. Choice d, giving 100% oxygen, is a possible next step after clearing the airway, but again, it is not the initial priority. Choice e, intubating and ventilating the patient, is a more advanced intervention that should only be done by trained healthcare professionals. Therefore, the correct answer is b, clear airway, as it addresses the most urgent need of ensuring that the patient is breathing properly.",b,b,TRUE,

This patient's symptoms and fundus exam indicate a blockage in the central retinal vein, which can cause hemorrhages and decreased vision in one eye. Option a, htn retinopathy, can cause similar findings but usually affects both eyes and doesn't present with sudden vision loss. Options b, d, and e are also unlikely based on the given information. It's important to correctly diagnose a central retinal vein thrombosis as it can be a sign of underlying systemic conditions such as hypertension or blood clotting disorders. Treatment may include addressing these underlying causes and managing symptoms such as use of anti-coagulation therapy or laser surgery.",c,c,TRUE,
373. a mentally retarded child puts a green pea in his ear while eating. the carer confirms this. otoscopy shows a green colored object in the ear canal. what is the most appropriate single best approach to remove this object?,a. by magnet,b. syringing,c. under ga,d. by hook,e. by instilling olive oil,,,,,,"key: the key is under ga. [pea is not a magnetic material and hence it cannot be removed by magnet, it will swell up if syringing is attempted, as hook placement is likely with risk of pushing the pea deeper it is not also suitable in a mentally retarded child, and olive oil is not of help in case of pea. so to avoid injury it is better to remove under ga].","The most appropriate single best approach to remove a green pea from a mentally retarded child's ear is by performing the procedure under general anesthesia (GA). Using a magnet is not an option since peas are not magnetic. Syringing is not recommended as it can cause the pea to swell and become harder to remove. Moreover, attempting to use a hook may push the object deeper into the ear, which can potentially cause more harm. Likewise, instilling olive oil is unlikely to be effective in dislodging the pea. Therefore, to avoid injury and ensure the safe and complete removal of the pea, performing the procedure under GA is the best option.",c,c,TRUE,

[there is dilatation in oesophagus which is seen both in achalasia and carcinoma. dysphagia to solid initaially is very much suggestive of carcinoma and also barrett’s change is a clue to carcinoma],"Based on the symptoms and diagnostic findings provided, the single most appropriate diagnosis for the patient is e. esophageal carcinoma. The dilation in the esophagus seen in both achalasia and carcinoma suggests that the symptoms could be caused by either condition. However, the presence of Barrett's esophagus, which is a known precursor to esophageal cancer, indicates that the most likely diagnosis is esophageal carcinoma. Additionally, the progressively worsening dysphagia to solids and then liquids is a common symptom of advanced esophageal cancer. Options b and c, esophageal spasm and GERD, respectively, do not explain the dilation of the esophagus with tapered end seen on the barium enema. Option d, Barrett's esophagus, is a precursor to esophageal cancer but does not fully explain the patient's current symptoms. Therefore, option e, esophageal carcinoma, is the most appropriate diagnosis.",e,e,TRUE,

Paget's disease of the breast. This disease typically affects the nipple and areola and presents with itching, ulceration, redness, discharge, and eczema-like changes. Although fibrocystic dysplasia, breast abscess, duct papilloma, and eczema can also cause similar symptoms, they usually do not involve the nipple specifically. A breast abscess would likely also present with a fever, while duct papilloma and fibrocystic dysplasia may present with a palpable mass. Ultimately, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Paget's disease of the breast.",a,a,TRUE,
376.  pt with widespread ovarian carcinoma has bowel obstruction and severe colic for 2h and was normal in between severe pain for a few hours. what is the most appropriate management?,a. pca (morphine),b. spasmolytics,c. palliative colostomy,d. oral morphine,e. laxatives,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is c. palliative colostomy. key: 2. cancer or chemotherapy induced obstructions are unlikely to respond to conservative management [nbm, iv fluid, nasogastric suction] and hence only analgesia will not relieve it. so in such cases we have to go for palliative colostomy.","In this scenario, the most appropriate management option would be c. palliative colostomy. This is because the patient has a bowel obstruction and severe colic for 2 hours, which is unlikely to respond to conservative management such as NBM, IV fluid, and nasogastric suction. Additionally, the patient has had normal periods in between severe pain for a few hours. This suggests that the obstruction may be caused by cancer or chemotherapy, which are unlikely to respond to analgesia alone. While options such as PCA (morphine), spasmolytics, and oral morphine may provide temporary relief, they do not address the underlying cause of the obstruction. Laxatives are also inappropriate as they may worsen the obstruction. Therefore, the most appropriate management in this case would be to perform a palliative colostomy.",c,c,TRUE,
377. a 70yo man admits to asbestos exposure 20yrs ago and has attempted to quit smoking. he has noted weight loss and hoarseness of voice. choose the single most likely type of cancer a.w risk factors present.,a. basal cell carcinoma,b. bronchial carcinoma,c. esophageal carcinoma,d. nasopharyngeal carcinoma,e. oral carcinoma,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. bronchial carcinoma. [asbestos exposure is a risk factor for lung cancer and also has a synergistic effect with cigarette smoke. horseness can be from involvement of recurrent laryngeal nerve]. key: 2. conditions related to asbestos exposure: i) pleural plaques (after a latent period of 20-40 yrs) ii) pleural thickening iii) asbestosis (latent period is typically 15-30 yrs) iv) mesothelioma (prognosis is very poor) v) lung cancer.,"The most likely type of cancer in this 70-year-old man with a history of asbestos exposure and hoarseness of voice is b. bronchial carcinoma, also known as lung cancer. Asbestos exposure is a well-known risk factor for lung cancer, and the fact that he has attempted to quit smoking also puts him at higher risk for this type of cancer. The presence of weight loss is also concerning for a malignancy. The other types of cancer listed (basal cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and oral carcinoma) do not have a strong association with asbestos exposure or smoking, and would not be the most likely diagnosis in this patient given his history and symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
378. a 32yo woman had progressive decrease in vision over 3yrs. she is now dx as almost blind. what would be the mechanism?,a. cataract,b. glaucoma,c. retinopathy,d. uveitis,e. keratitis,,,,,,"key: 1. the key is b. glaucoma. this is wrong key! correct option is retinopathy. key: 2. cataract is unlikely at this age. uveitis and iritis doesn’t have such degree of vision loss and iritis and anterior uveitis have pain, redness and photophobia. open angle glaucoma mostly occurs after the age of 50yrs. answer should be retinopathy (example retinitis pigmentosa).","The correct answer to this question is c. retinopathy, specifically retinitis pigmentosa. Cataract is unlikely at this age and would not lead to a progressive decrease in vision over 3 years. Glaucoma mostly occurs after the age of 50 and also typically does not have such a rapid rate of vision loss. Uveitis and keratitis typically present with redness, pain, and photophobia and would not necessarily lead to blindness. Retinopathy, specifically retinitis pigmentosa, is a genetic disorder that leads to a progressive degeneration of the retina, resulting in night blindness, tunnel vision, and eventually, legal blindness. Therefore, based on the given information, retinopathy is the most likely mechanism for this woman's progressive decrease in vision.",c,c,TRUE,
"379. a child during operation and immediately after showed glycosuria, but later his urine sugar was normal. choose the most probable dx.",a. pre-diabetic state,b. normal finding,c. low renal tubular threshold,d. dm,,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. normal finding. key: 2. stress during operation can cause transient hyperglycemia causing glycosuria secondary to stress induced rise of cortisole which becomes normal after some time.,"The correct answer is b. normal finding. It is not uncommon for stress during an operation to cause a transient hyperglycemia, which can then cause glycosuria. This is due to the stress-induced rise of cortisol. However, once the stress has subsided, the cortisol levels return to normal, and so does the child's urine sugar. Therefore, the child does not have a pre-diabetic state or diabetes (answer a and d). Low renal tubular threshold (answer c) is a condition where the kidneys excrete glucose even when blood sugar levels are normal, but this is not the cause of the child's glycosuria in this case. In conclusion, the most probable diagnosis for this child is a normal finding, and the transient glycosuria is a result of stress during the operation.",b,b,TRUE,
"380. a pt presented with hx of swelling in the region of the sub-mandibular region, which became more prominent and painful on chewing. he also gave hx of sour taste in the mouth, the area is tender on palpation. choose the most probable dx?",a. chronic recurrent sialadenitis,b. adenolymphoma,c. mikulicz’s disease,d. adenoid cystic carcinoma,e. sub-mandibular abscess,,,,,,"key: the key is a. chronic recurrent sialadenitis. [pain, swelling, more pain on chewing, tenderness, and submandibular region suggests diagnosis of submandibular chronic recurrent sialadenitis, usually secondary to sialolithiasis or stricture].","Based on the symptoms provided, the most probable diagnosis is chronic recurrent sialadenitis (a). The sub-mandibular region swelling, tenderness, and pain on chewing are suggestive of sub-mandibular chronic recurrent sialadenitis, which is usually secondary to sialolithiasis (presence of salivary gland stones) or stricture (narrowing of the duct that leads to the gland). The sour taste in the mouth may also suggest an obstruction of the salivary gland duct. Adenolymphoma (b) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (d) are malignant tumors, therefore less likely to be the diagnosis. Mikulicz's disease (c) is a rare condition that affects multiple. organ systems and is typically associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Sub-mandibular abscess (e) is a possibility but would typically be associated with fever, local warmth, erythema, and fluctuance and would require immediate drainage. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is chronic recurrent sialadenitis due to sialolithiasis or stricture.",a,a,TRUE,

[saw-tooth like waves, normal qrs complex of 80 ms (normal range 70-100 ms), ventricular rate of 150/min and regular r-r interval is diagnostic of atrial flutter].","The correct answer is b, atrial flutter. The presence of saw-tooth like waves on the ECG, along with a normal QRS complex duration, a ventricular rate of 150 beats per minute, and a regular R-R interval are all typical of atrial flutter. Atrial fibrillation (option a) would show irregularly irregular R-R intervals and no visible P waves, and SVT (option c) would show a narrower QRS complex and a higher rate. Mobitz type 1 second degree heart block (option d) would show progressively lengthening PR intervals leading up to a dropped beat, and sinus tachycardia (option e) would have a different appearance on the ECG and a faster or slower rate depending on the cause. Therefore, based on the specific ECG findings described, the most probable diagnosis is atrial flutter.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient is showing symptoms of increased thirst, confusion, and drowsiness, which are commonly seen in hypercalcemia. Solid organ tumors are known to produce hypercalcemia, and in this case, the probable cause could be the treated breast cancer that the patient had three years ago. The other options, such as hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hypocalcemia, do not present with the same set of symptoms and are thus less likely to be the correct answer. In conclusion, hypercalcemia is the most likely metabolic abnormality in this scenario due to the patient's symptoms and medical history.",a,a,TRUE,

Reduced uptake on thyroid isotope scan is the most likely to be associated with the diagnosis of thyroiditis caused by a viral infection. This is because in viral or subacute thyroiditis, there is a decreased uptake of radioactive iodine by the gland due to inflammation and damage to the thyroid tissue. This diagnostic criterion is supported by the patient's symptoms of weight loss, heat intolerance, poor concentration, and palpitations. The other choices are less likely to be associated with viral or subacute thyroiditis. Bilateral exophthalmos suggests Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder and not caused by a viral infection. Diffuse, smooth goiter could be seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, another autoimmune disorder, or iodine deficiency, but not necessarily in viral thyroiditis. Positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies are indicative of autoimmune thyroid disease. Pretibial myxedema is a skin condition that is associated with Graves' disease. Therefore, the most likely answer is c, reduced uptake on thyroid isotope scan, because it is a specific diagnostic criterion for viral or subacute thyroiditis in the context of the patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

This involves a thorough examination of the stoma site to identify the cause of the swelling. It may involve palpation, probing, wound exploration, and visual inspection of the stoma. Other management options such as exploratory laparotomy or open laparotomy are unnecessary as they involve major surgical procedures that are not indicated in this case. Reassuring the patient does not address the underlying issue and does not provide a solution to the swelling. Therefore, local exploration is the best management option as it allows for quick identification and treatment of the cause of the swelling.",a,a,TRUE,

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. It has been associated with an increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma, which can present with vaginal bleeding. Choices a, c, d, and e are unlikely to be caused by tamoxifen. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient for vaginal bleeding in order to detect any potential complications associated with tamoxifen use.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient's ECG changes are suggestive of hyperkalemia which commonly occurs in acute renal failure. At potassium levels of >5.5meq/l, tall tented T waves are seen and at potassium levels >7meq/l, wide QRS complex with bizarre morphology occurs. IV calcium chloride can be used to prevent arrhythmias caused by elevated potassium levels. Dialysis could be considered if the patient's acute renal failure is due to uremic toxins but it is not the immediate management in this case. IV insulin with dextrose is used to shift potassium from extracellular to intracellular space and is not the best initial therapy in this unstable patient. Calcium resonium can be used to bind excess potassium in the gut but it is not the initial therapy in this case. Nebulized salbutamol may be used in mild to moderate hyperkalemia but it is not the next best step in this severe case with ECG changes. Thus, the best immediate step to manage this patient is to administer IV calcium chloride to prevent arrhythmias caused by hyperkalemia.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the patient's symptoms are suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs that can occur after surgery. A CTPA, or computed tomography pulmonary angiography, is the most sensitive and specific test for detecting pulmonary embolism. A CXR may show signs of heart failure, but is not specific for pulmonary embolism. A V/Q scan may be an alternative if there is renal impairment or allergy to contrast media, but a CTPA is preferred. A D-dimer may be elevated in many conditions, and is not specific for pulmonary embolism. Finally, a Doppler ultrasound of the legs is used to detect deep vein thrombosis, which can be a risk factor for pulmonary embolism, but will not confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the girl has been treated with penicillin and has developed a skin rash and itching, which are common symptoms of erythema multiforme caused by antibiotics, including penicillin. Erythema nodosum (a) is a less severe condition and is characterized by painful reddish lumps on the shins. SJS (c) is a rare and severe allergic reaction to medication that affects the skin and mucous membranes. Erythema marginatum (d) is a rash associated with rheumatic fever and is characterized by non-itchy flat or slightly raised red rings with a clear center.

[atrial fibrillation: post stroke- following a stroke or tia warfarine should be given as the anticoagulant of choice. nice guideline].,"The correct answer for this question is a. Warfarin. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and stroke makes him at a higher risk of future stroke. According to NICE guideline, warfarin should be given as the anticoagulant of choice for prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation following a stroke or TIA. Heparin, aspirin, statins and beta-blockers are not the first line of treatment for this patient population as their efficacy and safety profile is inferior to warfarin. Heparin is used primarily for acute thrombosis, while aspirin, statins and beta-blockers do not provide sufficient stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, warfarin is the best prophylactic regimen for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,

The inner ear is involved in hearing and balance, but would not cause the specific symptoms listed. The brain stem, diencephalon, and cerebrum are also involved in various functions, but do not typically cause ataxia and intention tremors unless they are also affecting the cerebellum. Therefore, the correct answer is e. cerebellum.",e,e,TRUE,

Blood group A is associated with gastric cancer, and the patient is experiencing common symptoms of the disease including vomiting, tiredness, weight loss, and palpitations (from anemia of cancer). The exam also reveals hepatomegaly and ascites, which are late features of gastric cancer that indicate metastasis. The palpable left supraclavicular mass is known as Virchow's gland and has long been regarded as strongly indicative of gastric cancer. Colorectal carcinoma (B), peptic ulcer disease (C), atrophic gastritis (D), and Krukenberg tumor (E) do not align with the symptoms and exam findings of this patient and can be ruled out.",a,a,TRUE,

[agitation, nervousness, abdominal cramp, sweating, shivering and piloerection, arthralgia these are features of heroin withdrawal].","The correct answer to the question is b. heroin, as the symptoms presented suggest withdrawal from this specific drug. Heroin withdrawal symptoms include agitation, nervousness, abdominal cramps, sweating, shivering, joint pain, and piloerection. Other drugs listed in the options, such as alcohol, cocaine, LSD, and ecstasy, may produce different or similar symptoms, but they do not match all the symptoms presented by the patient in this case. Therefore, the most likely substance misuse is heroin, and the patient should be evaluated and treated accordingly to address her addiction.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the picture suggests obstructive jaundice, which can be diagnosed with a USG. Although LFTs can provide clues like much raised bilirubin and raised alkaline phosphatase, they are not enough for diagnosis. TFTs and endomyseal antibodies are not relevant to this presentation, and a sweat test is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is not associated with obstructive jaundice. Therefore, a US abdomen is the most appropriate test to confirm obstructive jaundice in this child.",a,a,TRUE,

[features are suggestive of acaustic neuroma, so mri is the preferred option].","The most appropriate investigation for this patient's condition is option C, MRI. The patient's symptoms and presentation are suggestive of acoustic neuroma, a benign tumor that develops on the eighth cranial nerve. The MRI exam is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose this condition as it provides detailed images of the brain and internal auditory canal. Audiometry may help provide additional information about the extent of hearing loss, but it will not confirm the diagnosis. Tympanometry and Weber's test are unlikely to be helpful in this case. CT scans may show bone destruction around the internal auditory canal but are less sensitive in detecting small acoustic neuromas. Therefore, the best course of action is to perform an MRI to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of acoustic neuroma.",c,c,TRUE,
"396. a 56 yo lady with lung cancer presents with urinary retention, postural hypotension, diminished reflexes and sluggish pupillary reaction. what is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?",a. paraneoplastic syndrome,b. progression of lung cancer,c. brain metastasis,d. hyponatremia,e. spinal cord compression,,,,,,key: the key is a. paraneoplastic syndrome. [features given are well known features of autonomic neuropathy which can be a result of paraneoplastic syndrome].,"The most likely explanation for the symptoms of a 56-year-old woman with lung cancer who presents with urinary retention, postural hypotension, diminished reflexes, and sluggish pupillary reaction is a paraneoplastic syndrome. The features described are well-known features of autonomic neuropathy, which can result from an underlying paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of rare disorders that occur when cancer-fighting antibodies or white blood cells attack normal cells in the body, causing a wide range of symptoms. The remaining options, such as brain metastasis, progression of lung cancer, hyponatremia, and spinal cord compression, can all cause different symptoms than those described in the question. Therefore, the answer is a, paraneoplastic syndrome, and the other choices are not as likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[age and normal pupil and cornea are suggestive of cataract. if it was glaucoma pupil would be a bit dilated and/or oval in shape].,"The most likely diagnosis for an old woman who is experiencing decreased vision and difficulty seeing properly at night, despite having changed her glasses multiple times and with normal pupil and cornea, is cataract (answer a). This is supported by the patient's age as well as the absence of any other signs indicative of glaucoma (such as dilated or oval-shaped pupil), retinal detachment, iritis, or giant cell arteritis (options b-e). Overall, the normal pupil and cornea coupled with the patient's age and history of decreased vision strongly suggest the presence of cataract as the underlying cause.",a,a,TRUE,
398. a pt comes with sudden loss of vision. on fundoscopy the optic disc is normal. what is the underlying pathology?,a. iritis,b. glaucoma,c. vitreous chamber,d. retinal detachment,,,,,,,key: 1. the key is d. retinal detachment. [at an early stage optic disc remains normal in retinal detachment]. key: 2. causes of sudden painless loss of vision: 1.	retinal detachment 2.	vitreous haemorrhage 3.	retinal vein occlusion 4.	retinal artery occlusion 5.	optic neuritis 6.	cerebrovascular accident,"The correct answer is d. retinal detachment. This is because, even though sudden painless loss of vision can be caused by various conditions, such as vitreous hemorrhage, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion, optic neuritis, and cerebrovascular accident, in this particular case, the optic disc is normal. This means that the underlying pathology is not related to the optic nerve or the vitreous chamber, ruling out options b and c. Iritis, option a, can cause visual disturbances, including blurring or floaters, but not sudden loss of vision with a normal optic disc. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the patient is experiencing a retinal detachment, which requires prompt medical attention to prevent permanent vision loss.",d,d,TRUE,
399. a child was woken up from sleep with severe pain in the testis. exam: tenderness on palpation and only one testis was normal in size and position. what would be your next step?,a. analgesia,b. antibiotics,c. refer urgently to a surgeon,d. reassurance,e. discharge with analgesics,,,,,,key: the key is a. analgesia. [according to some us sites it is analgesia but no uk site support this! so for plab exam the more acceptable option is c. refer urgently to a surgeon].,"In this scenario, the correct answer would be c. refer urgently to a surgeon. This is because the symptoms suggest a possible testicular torsion, a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention. Analgesia alone may provide temporary relief but will not treat the underlying issue. Antibiotics are not necessary in this situation and may not be effective. Reassurance and discharge with analgesics are not appropriate given the potential severity of the condition. It is important to act promptly in cases of suspected testicular torsion to avoid potential complications such as necrosis or infertility.",c,c,TRUE,
"400. a child suffering from asthma presents with temp 39c, drooling saliva on to the mother’s lap, and taking oxygen by mask. what sign will indicate that he is deteriorating?",a. intercostal recession,b. diffuse wheeze,c. drowsiness,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. intercostal recession. this is wrong key. correct key is c. drowsiness. [intercostal recession is a sign of severe asthma but it can be seen at a lesser degree as well. so drowsiness is more appropriate answer].,"The correct answer to this question is c. drowsiness. While intercostal recession can be a sign of severe asthma, it can also occur at a lesser degree and may not necessarily indicate deterioration. Diffuse wheezing is a common symptom of asthma and may not necessarily indicate deterioration either. However, drowsiness is a worrisome sign as it can indicate that the child's oxygen levels are dropping and their body is becoming fatigued from the effort of breathing. It is important to monitor for signs of drowsiness and seek medical attention promptly if it is observed.",c,c,TRUE,
401. a 12yo boy presents with painful swollen knee after a sudden fall. which bursa is most likely to be affected?,a. semimembranous bursa,b. prepatellar bursa,c. pretibial bursa,d. suprapatetaller bursa,,,,,,,"key: the key is b. prepatellar bursa. [a fall onto the knee can damage the prepatellar bursa. this usually causes bleeding into the bursa sac causing swellen painful knee. prepatellar bursitis that is caused by an injury will usually go away on its own. the body will absorb the blood in the bursa over several weeks, and the bursa should return to normal. if swelling in the bursa is causing a slow recovery, a needle may be inserted to drain the blood and speed up the process. there is a slight risk of infection in putting a needle into the bursa].","The correct answer to the question is b. prepatellar bursa. This is because a fall onto the knee can damage the prepatellar bursa, leading to bleeding into the bursa sac and resulting in a swollen and painful knee. Prepatellar bursitis caused by an injury usually resolves on its own as the body absorbs the blood in the bursa over several weeks. However, if swelling persists and slows down the recovery process, drainage of the blood may be required using a needle. It is important to note that there is a slight risk of infection associated with the use of a needle in this procedure. Choices a, c, and d are incorrect as there is no direct correlation between these bursae and an injury resulting from a fall onto the knee.",b,b,TRUE,
402. a 61yo man has been referred to the opd with frequent episodes of breathlessness and chest pain a/w palpitations. he has a regular pulse rate=60bpm. ecg=sinus rhythm. what is the most appropriate inv to be done?,a. cardiac enzymes,b. cxr,c. ecg,d. echo,e. 24h ecg,,,,,,"key: the key is e. 24h ecg. indications of 24 h ambulatory holter monitoring: •	to evaluate chest pain not reproduced with exercise testing •	to evaluate other signs and symptoms that may be heart-related, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting •	to identify arrhythmias or palpitations •	to assess risk for future heart-related events in certain conditions, such as idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, post-heart attack with weakness of the left side of the heart, or wolff-parkinson-white syndrome •	to assess the function of an implanted pacemaker •	to determine the effectiveness of therapy for complex arrhythmias","The correct answer is e - 24h ecg. This is because the patient is experiencing frequent episodes of breathlessness and chest pain accompanied by palpitations, indicating a possible arrhythmia. A 24-hour ambulatory holter monitoring is the most appropriate investigation to identify arrhythmias or palpitations that may not be detected on a routine ECG. Cardiac enzymes are used to diagnose a heart attack, which is not indicated in this case. A CXR is used to diagnose respiratory pathologies, which may not be relevant to the patient's symptoms. An ECG has already been done and showed sinus rhythm. An Echo is used to evaluate the heart structure and function, which may not be relevant to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate investigation for this patient's symptoms is a 24-hour ambulatory holter monitoring.",e,e,TRUE,
403. a woman dx with ca breast presents now with urinary freq. which part of the brain is the metastasis spread to?,a. brain stem,b. pons,c. medulla,d. diencephalon,e. cerebral cortex,,,,,,key: the key is d. diencephalon. [diencephalon is made up of four distinct components: i) the thalamus ii) the subthalamus iii) the hypothalamus and iv) the epithalamus. among these the hypothalamus has crucial role in causing urinary frequency].,"The correct answer is d) diencephalon. The diencephalon is a distinct component of the brain that consists of four parts, including the hypothalamus which plays a crucial role in causing urinary frequency. Therefore, if a woman with breast cancer is presenting with urinary frequency, it is possible that metastasis has spread to the diencephalon. The other options (brain stem, pons, medulla, and cerebral cortex) are not likely to cause urinary frequency. The brain stem, pons, and medulla are responsible for vital functions such as breathing and heart rate, while the cerebral cortex is responsible for perception, thinking, and voluntary movement.",d,d,TRUE,

[this patient is refusing any help offered! and his son cannot deal with him anymore! in this situation voluntary admission to psychiatry ward is not possible and the option of choice is “compulsory admission under mha”. the point here is the man has felt himself in danger by self neglect].,"In this scenario, the most appropriate next step would be compulsory admission under Mental Health Act (MHA) as the patient is refusing any help offered and his son cannot deal with him anymore. Voluntary admission to psychiatry ward is not an option in this case. The patient is in danger due to self-neglect, which makes it necessary to use the option of compulsory admission under MHA. This option has been chosen because the man is experiencing severe depression and misery after his wife's death, and he sees no point in living. He apologises for his existence and refuses any help offered. Referring to social services or providing alternate housing is not enough in this case, and ECT is not appropriate for this type of depression. Therefore, compulsory admission under MHA is the most appropriate next step.",b,b,TRUE,
405. a 31yo man has epistaxis 10 days following polypectomy. what is the most likely dx?,a. nasal infection,b. coagulation disorder,c. carcinoma,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. nasal infection. [infection is one of the most important cause of secondary hemorrhage].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 31-year-old man experiencing epistaxis 10 days after polypectomy is a nasal infection. Infection is one of the most significant causes of secondary hemorrhage, and the recent surgical procedure could have introduced bacteria into the nasal cavity, leading to infection. Coagulation disorders and carcinoma are less likely in this case, as the patient had no previous history, and the postoperative bleeding occurred after a considerable time frame. Coagulation disorders also typically result in continuous bleeding and are not localized to one area, whereas carcinoma does not present with sudden onset bleeding. Therefore, a nasal infection is the most likely cause for this patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[now a days pci is considered to have much better outcome than thrombolysis].,"The correct answer to this question is c. angiography. While thrombolysis (using streptokinase) used to be a common treatment for MI, nowadays percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is considered to have a better outcome. In the scenario presented, the patient's response to oxygen and GTN suggest that her symptoms have improved, but her heart rate is dangerously low and the ECG shows ST elevation in multiple leads. This indicates the need for further investigation through angiography to evaluate potential blockages in the coronary arteries and determine the appropriate treatment approach. LMWH (answer choice a) may be used in some cases, but is not the next step in this particular scenario. Continuing current management (answer choice d) is not advisable given the low heart rate and ST elevation present on the ECG. Therefore, the correct answer is c. angiography.",c,c,TRUE,

[age at presentation and class1 obesity favours the diagnosis of type2 dm].,"The correct answer is e. Blood sugar. The patient is presenting with symptoms of polyuria and nocturia, which are common in diabetes mellitus. Additionally, his BMI of 33 and negative urine culture for nitrates are both risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the next diagnostic investigation should be a blood sugar test to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The other choices (a, b, c, and d) are not appropriate for the presenting symptoms and risk factors of this patient. A PSA test is used for prostate cancer screening, urea, creatinine, and electrolyte tests are used to assess kidney function, a MSU culture and sensitivity test is used for urinary tract infections, and an acid-fast urine test is used for identifying tuberculosis infection – none of which are relevant to the patient's presentation.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that typically appears as red, painful, and tender nodules on the lower legs. It is most commonly caused by streptococcus infections or sarcoidosis, but can also be caused by other infections such as tuberculosis or mycoplasma pneumonia, as well as certain drugs and autoimmune diseases. Lupus vulgaris, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema marginatum, and solar keratosis are all different skin conditions that present with different symptoms and characteristics, and are not typically associated with a nodular patch on the shin that is reddish-brown.",b,b,TRUE,

Beta blockers. This patient is likely experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF) secondary to thyrotoxicosis, as indicated by her symptoms of palpitations and feeling warmer than usual, as well as her irregular heart rate of 154 bpm. Beta blockers can help control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism by reducing the effects of excess thyroid hormone on the cardiac and nervous system. Additionally, beta blockers can improve the patient's arrhythmia. Amiodarone (a class III antiarrhythmic) may be used for AF, but it is not the first-line treatment in this case. Adenosine and verapamil are used for certain types of supraventricular tachycardia, but not for AF. Flecainide is another class Ic antiarrhythmic that can be used for AF, but again, it is not the first-line treatment in this case. Overall, beta blockers are the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition.",b,b,TRUE,

This involves stopping oral hypoglycemic medication the previous night and starting IV insulin with glucose and K+ before the surgery. This is because oral hypoglycemic medications can increase the risk of hypoglycemia during surgery, and IV insulin allows for better control of blood glucose levels compared to oral medications. Option a, starting IV insulin and glucose and K+ just before the surgery, may not be enough time to adequately control blood glucose levels before the procedure. Option b, stopping oral hypoglycemic on the day of the procedure, may also not provide enough time to adequately control blood glucose levels. Option c, continuing regular oral hypoglycemic, may increase the risk of hypoglycemia during surgery. Lastly, option e, changing to short-acting oral hypoglycemic, may also increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, option d is the most appropriate pre-op management for a T2DM undergoing gastric surgery.",d,d,TRUE,

Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Autism Spectrum Disorders affect social interaction, communication (both verbal and nonverbal), and behaviors and interests. The boy's lack of social interaction and limited communication, combined with his intense interest in collecting cars, are all consistent with symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The other choices are not appropriate as they do not align with the boy's symptoms. Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized by unstable moods, behaviors, and relationships, depression is characterized by persistent sadness and a lack of interest in activities, and Schizoaffective Disorder is a mental health condition that causes disordered thinking and abnormal behavior.",d,d,TRUE,

[nature of pain i.e. sharp pain increased by breathing and relieved by sitting forward is suggestive of pericarditis]. nature of pericardial pain: the most common symptom is sharp, stabbing chest pain behind the sternum  or in the left side of your chest. however, some people with acute pericarditis describe their chest pain as dull, achy or pressure-like instead, and of varying intensity. the pain of acute pericarditis may radiate to your left shoulder and neck. it often intensifies when you cough, lie down or inhale deeply. sitting up and leaning forward can often ease the pain.","The correct answer is b. pericarditis. The nature of the pain, which is sharp, increased by breathing and relieved by sitting forward, is highly suggestive of pericarditis. The most common symptom of pericardial pain is a sharp, stabbing chest pain behind the sternum or in the left side of the chest, although it can also be described as dull, achy or pressure-like. The pain may radiate to the left shoulder and neck and intensify when coughing, lying down, or inhaling deeply. Sitting up and leaning forward can often ease the pain. The other choices listed are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and medical history. MI is a possibility, but the nature of the pain would not be relieved by sitting forward. Lung cancer and progressive massive fibrosis would most likely present with chronic symptoms and not a sudden onset of severe symptoms. Goodpasture's syndrome is characterized by lung and kidney involvement, but the presented symptoms do not suggest kidney involvement. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis based on the given information is b. pericarditis.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient is showing signs of developing a paralytic ileus, which is a medical condition where there is a decrease in the normal motility of the intestines, leading to bowel distention, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The best initial approach is to use conservative management, such as NG tube suction and IV fluids, to decompress the bowel, and provide adequate hydration and electrolytes. Antibiotic therapy (option a) may be used if there is an infection, but should not be the first approach. Glycerine suppository (option b) is not indicated in a case of paralytic ileus.

[the patient probably developed diabetic foot].,"The correct answer to this question is c. Blood sugar. The patient's symptoms, including thirst, urinary frequency and weight loss, are indicative of diabetes. The deep, painless ulcer on the heel is consistent with a diabetic foot ulcer, a common complication of uncontrolled diabetes. Therefore, checking blood sugar levels is the most appropriate investigation to determine the diagnosis and treatment plan for this patient. Option a, arteriography, and b, venography, are not necessary in this case as there are no indications of peripheral arterial disease or deep vein thrombosis. Option d, biopsy for malignant melanoma, and e, biopsy for pyoderma, are not relevant as the symptoms do not suggest these conditions. Checking blood sugar levels will provide crucial information for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because HSP is a type of vasculitis that commonly causes rashes on the buttocks, legs, and feet, and may also appear on the arms, face, and trunk. On the other hand, ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia) usually causes a rash in the lower legs and occurs as a result of a deficiency of platelets due to their destruction in the spleen. HSP is more likely to follow a sore throat, while ITP is commonly caused by viral infections such as flu or URti. Therefore, the correct key for this case is e, and the other choices listed (measles, bullous-pemphigoid, rubella, and ITP) are less likely to be the correct diagnosis.",e,e,TRUE,

The submandibular lymph node is located in the submandibular triangle, which is in close proximity to the mid-third of the tongue. White patches on the tongue can be indicative of various conditions, such as leukoplakia or oral thrush. These conditions can sometimes lead to the spread of cancerous cells to nearby lymph nodes. While the other lymph nodes listed may drain other areas of the body, they are not as directly associated with the mid-third of the tongue as the submandibular lymph node. Therefore, the answer of G is the most appropriate for this scenario.",g,g,TRUE,

[it is a case of retinal detachment with treatment option of scleral buckling].,"The correct answer to the question is option c, scleral buckling. This is because the patient is presenting with retinal detachment, which needs to be urgently treated to prevent permanent loss of vision. Scleral buckling is a surgical technique that involves the placement of a silicone band around the eye to push the sclera inwards, thus relieving the traction on the retina and allowing it to reattach. Pan retinal photo coagulation (option a) is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy and is not necessary for this patient. Peripheral iridectomy (option b) is a treatment for angle closure glaucoma and is not relevant in this case. Spectacles (option d) and surgical extraction of the lens (option e) are also not appropriate for this patient's condition. Therefore, the single most appropriate treatment for this patient is scleral buckling.",c,c,TRUE,

Both acute and chronic subdural hematomas can cause fluctuating levels of consciousness, intellectual slowing, sleepiness, headache, personality change, and unsteadiness - all of which are symptoms that the patient is experiencing. Head injury (option a) is a possibility, but given the patient's history and symptoms, subdural hematoma is a more likely cause. Hypoglycemia (option b) and delirium (option e) are also possible, but they do not fully explain all of the patient's symptoms. Extradural hematoma (option c) is less likely because the patient did not experience a significant trauma to the head, which is an important risk factor for this type of hematoma. Treatment for subdural hematoma includes irrigation/evacuation through a Barr Twist Drill and Barr Hole Craniostomy as the first-line approach, and craniotomy if the clot is organized, which is the second-line approach.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because the patient is exhibiting symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, specifically tremor and sweating, which can be effectively treated with benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. The other choices are not appropriate in this case. Acamprosate is used for maintaining abstinence in patients who have already withdrawn from alcohol. Chlordiazepoxide is an option for alcohol withdrawal but should only be used for a short period of time to prevent dependence and withdrawal. Lofexidine is a medication used to alleviate symptoms of opioid withdrawal and procyclidine is used for side effects of antipsychotics. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is lorazepam to manage his alcohol withdrawal symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[tonsillitis is usually caused by a viral infection or, less commonly, a bacterial infection. the given case is a bacterial tonsillitis (probably caused by group a streptococcus). there are four main signs that tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection. they are: •	a high temperature •	white pus-filled spots on the tonsils •	no cough •	swollen and tender lymph nodes (glands).","The single most relevant diagnosis for a 5-year-old child with a sore throat, earache, and pyrexia is b. acute follicular tonsillitis. This is because exam findings show enlarged and hyperemic tonsils that exude pus when pressed upon, which are characteristic of bacterial tonsillitis, likely caused by group A streptococcus. The other choices are incorrect because a. IM (infectious mononucleosis) typically presents with a prolonged sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue, but not earache or pus-filled tonsils; c. scarlet fever may present with a sore throat and fever, but typically has a rash in addition to other symptoms; d. agranulocytosis is a rare condition where the body doesn't produce enough white blood cells for infection fighting, and typically presents with more severe symptoms such as bleeding and gum ulcers; e. acute OM (otitis media) presents with ear pain and fever, but typically does not involve the tonsils.

Panic disorder is typically treated with either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or medication. NICE recommends a total of 7-14 hours of CBT to be completed within a 4 month period, while medication typically involves the use of SSRIs. In this case, fluoxetine is the most appropriate long-term treatment for the patient as it is an SSRI and has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of panic disorder. Diazepam and alprazolam, while they may be used for short-term relief of acute panic attacks, are not appropriate for long-term treatment due to their potential for addiction and side effects. Olanzapine and haloperidol are not indicated for the treatment of panic disorder as they are antipsychotic medications and do not target the underlying anxiety and panic symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,

Adenosine. When managing SVT, the first step is to attempt vagal maneuvers such as carotid sinus massage or the Valsalva maneuver, which transiently increase AV block and unmask the underlying atrial rhythm. If these maneuvers are unsuccessful, the first medication used is adenosine. Adenosine causes transient AV block by slowing the ventricles, revealing the underlying atrial rhythm, or cardioverting a junctional tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Amiodarone, lidocaine, verapamil, and metoprolol are not typically used as first-line treatments for SVT. It is important to note that the choice of medication may vary based on the patient's specific condition, and the management plan should be individualized accordingly.",b,b,TRUE,

This patient's depression is a significant feature of her bereavement, and discontinuing her antidepressant could lead to a deterioration of her depressive symptoms. However, the fact that her sleep has improved is a positive sign that she is responding well to the medication. For depressive episodes, it is recommended to continue antidepressant treatment for at least 6-9 months. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), psychoanalysis, and antipsychotic medication may all be potential treatment options for depression, but in this particular case, continuing the amitriptyline is the most appropriate management strategy. Bereavement counseling may also be helpful in addressing the patient's grief and coping with her loss, but it is not necessarily a substitute for antidepressant treatment.",b,b,TRUE,

Option b, aspirin 300mg for 2 weeks followed by aspirin 75mg and dipyridamole 200mg, is an outdated regimen and not the current recommended secondary prophylaxis. Option d, dipyridamole 200mg, is not recommended as monotherapy for secondary prophylaxis. Option e, aspirin 300mg for 2 weeks, is not sufficient for long-term prophylaxis. Clopidogrel 75mg is the preferred choice for secondary prophylaxis for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.

[short saphenous vein travels lateral aspect of ankle while great or long saphenous vein travels medial aspect of ankle].,"The correct answer for this question is A. Short Saphenous vein. This is because the patient's complaint of pigmentation along with the presence of dilated veins on the lateral side of her ankle indicates that there is a problem with the short saphenous vein. The short saphenous vein is responsible for carrying blood from the lateral aspect of the ankle, whereas the long saphenous vein travels from the medial side of the ankle. The deep venous system and popliteal veins are not involved in this case as the patient shows signs of superficial venous insufficiency. The saphano-femoral junction is also not involved as this condition is associated with deep venous thrombosis. Therefore, the answer is A and the other options can be eliminated based on the information provided.",a,a,TRUE,

[except high fiber diet all others are risk factors to develop rectal carcinoma].,"Rectal carcinoma is a type of cancer that arises from the cells lining the rectum. There are several risk factors that may contribute to its development. However, out of the given options, high fibre diet is the only one that is not a risk factor for rectal cancer. Smoking, family history, previous carcinoma, and polyps are all known risk factors for rectal cancer. High fat diet, on the other hand, may indirectly contribute to rectal cancer by promoting obesity and inflammation. Therefore, it is important to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle to reduce the risk of developing rectal carcinoma.",f,f,TRUE,

[bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotic drops].,"In this scenario, the most suitable treatment would be option c, antibiotic drops. The presentation of a painful and congested conjunctiva with redness and stickiness suggests a case of bacterial conjunctivitis, which is caused by a bacterial infection. Antibiotic drops are the most effective treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis and are prescribed to eliminate the bacteria causing the infection. Therefore, options b, d and e are incorrect because they are not suitable treatments for bacterial conjunctivitis. Antihistamines are used to treat allergies, and steroids are used to reduce inflammation, neither of which address the underlying bacterial infection. Option a, antibiotic po, is also inappropriate because oral antibiotics are not as effective as antibiotic drops in treating conjunctivitis. It is important to note that a proper diagnosis by a healthcare professional is necessary before any treatment is initiated.",c,c,TRUE,

Raynaud's phenomenon, pulmonary involvement, and esophageal dysmotility are common features of systemic sclerosis. Esophageal carcinoma (choice a) usually presents with dysphagia that is progressive and associated with weight loss rather than food sticking in the gullet. SLE (choice c) may cause dysphagia in rare cases but other symptoms such as joint pain and skin rashes are usually present. Pharyngeal carcinoma (choice d) could cause dysphagia but it is less likely given the presentation. Globus hystericus (choice e) is the sensation of a lump in the throat without any identifiable cause and is unlikely in this case given the other symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,

[skeletal survey is a series of x-ray which is usually used in nai]. [after survey should think of child protection].,"The correct answer is C, which is to perform a skeletal survey. A skeletal survey is a series of x-rays that can detect any injuries or abnormalities in the bones. Given that the child has multiple callus formations on their ribs, it is important to assess if these were caused by trauma or result from a medical condition. Additionally, the bruises found on the child's back may indicate physical abuse or neglect, hence performing a skeletal survey is crucial in assessing for any signs of non-accidental injury. Answer options B, D, and E are not as appropriate as skeletal survey since they do not directly address the child's injuries nor assess for possible abuse. Answer option A, checking the child protection register, may be necessary but not the most appropriate next step since it does not provide immediate medical attention nor help diagnose the child's condition. Therefore, performing a skeletal survey is the best next step to take in this situation as it helps to treat the child's injuries and assess for possible child abuse or neglect.",c,c,TRUE,

Acute leukemia is unlikely as the patient is otherwise well and there are no abnormal findings in the blood except for low platelet count. Aplastic anemia can be excluded by the normal WBC count. HIV infection and SLE are also unlikely as there are no specific symptoms or laboratory findings that suggest either condition. ITP is characterized by a low platelet count and bleeding symptoms, which is consistent with the patient's presentation. Therefore, the single most likely diagnosis is ITP.",d,d,TRUE,

Alcohol hallucinosis is a condition that can occur during acute intoxication or withdrawal and is characterized by auditory and visual hallucinations of accusatory or threatening voices. Delirium tremens (choice A) is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can cause confusion, tremors, and seizures, while Wernicke's encephalopathy (choice B) and Korsakoff's psychosis (choice C) are both neurological disorders caused by thiamine deficiency and typically develop in chronic alcoholics. Temporal lobe dysfunction (choice E) may also cause hallucinations, but it is not specific to alcohol consumption and requires further evaluation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D, alcohol hallucinosis, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and history.",d,d,TRUE,

[he who is already on aspirin need no change in aspirin dose. clopidogrel is now drug of choice for secondary prevention in tia but if someone is already on aspirin he should continue it as same dose and should be considered to shift to clopidogrel in next few visits. so for given case correct option is add statin only].,"The correct answer is e, to add a statin only. This is because the patient has a history of stroke and is at risk for another one, and statins have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence. The other options are not correct because adding clopidogrel is only considered if someone is not already on aspirin, and increasing the dose of aspirin is not recommended as the patient is already on the maximum dose for secondary prevention. Warfarin is not indicated in this case as the patient is in sinus rhythm and does not have atrial fibrillation. Therefore, adding only a statin is the appropriate action to reduce the patient's risk of another stroke.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because a berry aneurysm is a type of aneurysm that occurs in the blood vessels of the brain and is most commonly found in the circle of Willis. When a berry aneurysm ruptures, it can cause bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which is the space between the arachnoid and pia mater layers of the meninges that surround the brain and spinal cord. The other choices are incorrect because bleeding from a berry aneurysm would not occur in the subdural, extradural, subparietal, or brain ventricular spaces. It is important to identify the correct space where bleeding has occurred since different spaces may require different treatment and have different prognoses.",a,a,TRUE,

Hypnagogic hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur as a person is falling asleep, while hypnopompic hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur as a person is waking up. Hippocampal hallucinations and delirious hallucinations are not types of hallucinations, while auditory hallucinations can occur at any time and are not specific to the moments before falling asleep. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this schizophrenic patient who only hears voices before falling asleep is hypnagogic hallucinations.",b,b,TRUE,

This diagnosis is made based on the presence of caseating granulomata, which are diagnostic of tb. The other options are not appropriate because they do not match the patient's symptoms or the findings observed in the lymph nodes. Lymphoma would not present with caseating granulomata, and thyroid carcinoma, goiter, and thyroid cyst would not result in enlarged cervical lymph nodes or a cough and fever. Therefore, the best diagnosis for this patient is tb adenitis.",b,b,TRUE,

This is the most likely diagnosis in a 44yo man presenting with early morning headaches and vomiting, along with ring enhancing lesions on a CT brain scan. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The other options, such as CMV, streptococcus, NHL, and pneumocystis jerovii, are less likely causes in this case. CMV and pneumocystis jerovii may present with similar symptoms, but usually do not cause ring enhancing lesions on a CT brain scan. Streptococcus and NHL may also present with similar symptoms, but are less likely causes in this particular case. Therefore, the single most appropriate option is c. toxoplasmosis.",c,c,TRUE,

Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause sudden cardiac arrest. In vf, the heart's electrical signals become disorganized, causing the ventricles to quiver instead of contracting and pumping blood properly. Without immediate defibrillation to reset the heart's rhythm, vf can quickly lead to irreversible brain damage or death. Svt, or supraventricular tachycardia, is a fast heart rate originating from above the ventricles, and is not usually life-threatening. Vt, or ventricular tachycardia, is a fast, regular rhythm originating in the ventricles that can sometimes lead to vf if left untreated. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are irregular rhythms originating in the atria, which are not likely to cause sudden cardiac arrest on their own.",c,c,TRUE,

[in blunt trauma there may be hemo-pneumothorax but in sharp wound like stabbing there may occur only hemothorax].,"The correct answer is B, hemothorax. In this case, the patient had a penetrating injury to the right side of their back which resulted in bleeding into the pleural cavity. The CXR showed homogenous opacity, which is consistent with blood accumulation in the pleural space. Options A, D, and E are related to pneumothorax or air accumulation in the pleural cavity, which is not supported by the central position of the trachea in the CXR. Option C, pneumonia, would result in consolidation or patchy opacities which are not present in this CXR. Thus, hemothorax is the most probable explanation for the CXR findings.",b,b,TRUE,
"442. a 55yo woman complains of retrosternal chest pain and dysphagia which is intermittent and unpredictable. the food suddenly sticks in the middle of the chest, but she can clear it with a drink of water and then finish the meal without any further problem. a barium meal shows a ‘corkscrew esophagus’. what is the single most likely dysphagia?",a. esophageal candidiasis,b. esophageal carcinoma,c. esophageal spasm,d. pharyngeal pouch,e. plummer-vinson syndrome,,,,,,"key: the key is c. esophageal spasm. [chest pain, unpredictable intermittent dysphagia and food suddenly sticks in the middle of the chest which can be cleared with a drink of water indicates uncoordinated irregular esophageal peristalsis which is characteristic of esophageal spasm! also “cork-screw esophagus” seen in barium swallow is diagnostic of esophageal spasm].","The correct answer is c. Esophageal spasm. The symptoms described - retrosternal chest pain, intermittent dysphagia, and food sticking in the middle of the chest that can be relieved with a drink of water - are characteristic of uncoordinated irregular esophageal peristalsis, which is indicative of esophageal spasm. The presence of a 'corkscrew esophagus' on a barium swallow is also a diagnostic feature of esophageal spasm. Choices a, b, d, and e are not likely causes of the patient's dysphagia, as they do not match the symptoms or diagnostic findings described. Esophageal candidiasis may cause dysphagia but is typically seen in immunocompromised patients and would likely present with other symptoms such as white patches in the mouth. Esophageal carcinoma presents with progressive dysphagia and weight loss, and it is unlikely that a patient would be able to clear their symptoms with a drink of water. Pharyngeal pouch and Plummer-Vinson syndrome are rare and would not be the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[sudden loss of vision, remission and relapse of optic neuritis and focal neurological symptoms and exaggerated reflexes all points towards multiple sclerosis. treatment option is corticosteroids].","The correct answer for this question is c. corticosteroids. The clinical presentation of sudden loss of vision, remission and relapse of optic neuritis, mild weakness of right upper limb and exaggerated reflexes, all point towards a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The most appropriate treatment option for multiple sclerosis is corticosteroids as they have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve outcomes in patients with MS. The other answer choices such as a. pan retinal photo coagulation, b. pilocarpine eye drops, d. peripheral iridectomy, and e. surgical extraction of lens are not appropriate in the management of multiple sclerosis. Therefore, corticosteroids are the most appropriate single treatment option for this patient based on their clinical presentation and underlying diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,
"444. a 15yo boy presents with a limp and pain in the knee. exam: leg is externally rotated and 2cm shorter. there is limitation of flexion, abduction and medial rotation. as the hip is flexed external rotation is increased. choose the most likely dx?",a. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,b. osgood-schlatter disease,c. reactive arthritis,d. slipped femoral epiphysis,e. transient synovitis of the hip,,,,,,key: the key is d. slipped femoral epiphysis. [the given presentation is classic for slipped femoral epiphysis].,"Based on the presented symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is slipped femoral epiphysis (SFE), represented by option D. SFE occurs when the femoral head slips off the femoral neck, leading to characteristic symptoms such as a limp, knee pain, and limited range of motion. In SFE, the affected leg may appear externally rotated and shorter in comparison to the unaffected leg. The symptoms may aggravate with hip flexion or internal rotation. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (option A) is an inflammatory condition that affects multiple joints in the body, not just the hip joint as seen in this case. Osgood-Schlatter disease (option B) is a condition affecting the knee joint, which won't explain the symptoms observed in the hip joint. Reactive arthritis (option C), also known as Reiter's syndrome, is arthritis that occurs in response to the infection of either the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract, which isn't indicated in the provided details. Transient synovitis of the hip (option E) usually presents with a fever, but the given symptoms do not indicate a fever or inflammation in the hip joint. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is SFE, and further imaging studies should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,
445. a 64yo woman has difficulty moving her right shoulder on recovering from surgery of the posterior triangle of her neck. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. accessory nerve,b. glossopharyngeal nerve,c. hypoglossal nerve,d. vagus nerve,e. vestibule-cochlear nerve,,,,,,"key: the key is a. accessory nerve. [accessory nerve lesion causes weakness of the trapezius muscle and can produce a drooping shoulder, winged scapula, and a weakness of forward elevation of the shoulder].","The correct answer to this question is a. Accessory nerve. This is because a lesion to the accessory nerve can cause weakness of the trapezius muscle which can lead to a drooping shoulder, winged scapula, and weakness in forward elevation of the shoulder. This aligns with the given information of the woman experiencing difficulty moving her right shoulder after surgery in the posterior triangle of her neck. 

The other options presented, b. glossopharyngeal nerve, c. hypoglossal nerve, d. vagus nerve, and e. vestibule-cochlear nerve, do not relate to the given symptoms and context of the question. The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for sensory and motor functions in the throat and tongue, the hypoglossal nerve is responsible for tongue movement, the vagus nerve is responsible for many functions including regulation of internal organs, and the vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for hearing and balance. Therefore, the single most appropriate option in relation to the symptoms presented in the question is a. accessory nerve.",a,a,TRUE,
446. a 37yo man with an ulcer on the medial malleolus. which of the following ln is involved?,a. external iliac ln,b. pre-aortic ln,c. aortic ln,d. inguinal ln,e. iliac ln,f. submental ln,g. submandibular ln,h. deep cervical ln,,,key: the key is d. inguinal ln.,"The correct answer is d. inguinal ln. The inguinal lymph nodes are located in the groin area and drain lymph from the lower extremities, perineum, and external genitalia. The ulcer on the medial malleolus is likely due to an infection or injury in the lower leg or foot, which would cause lymph to drain to the inguinal lymph nodes. The other choices are all located in different regions of the body and would not typically be involved in draining lymph from this area. The external iliac lymph nodes drain lymph from the legs but are located higher up in the pelvis, while the pre-aortic and aortic lymph nodes are located in the abdomen and would not be involved in draining lymph from the lower extremities. The iliac lymph nodes are located more laterally and would not typically be involved in draining lymph from the medial malleolus. The submental and submandibular lymph nodes are located in the head and neck region, respectively, and the deep cervical lymph nodes are located along the neck. Therefore, the correct answer is d. inguinal lymph nodes, as these are the nodes most likely to be involved in draining lymph from the site of the ulcer.",d,d,TRUE,
"447. a pt presents with weight loss of 5kgs despite good appetite. he also complains of palpitations, sweating and diarrhea. he has a lump in front of his neck which moves on swallowing. what is the most appropriate dx?",a. lymphoma,b. tb adenitis,c. thyroid ca,d. goiter,e. thyroid cyst,,,,,,key: the key is d. goiter.,"The correct answer is d. goiter. This is because a goiter is a swelling or enlargement of the thyroid gland, which is located in the front of the neck. The weight loss, palpitations, sweating, and diarrhea, combined with the presence of a lump in the neck that moves on swallowing, all suggest that the thyroid gland is overactive, which is a characteristic of goiter. Lymphoma, TB adenitis, thyroid cancer, and thyroid cyst are all less likely diagnoses due to the specific symptoms presented by the patient. Lymphoma and TB adenitis would not lead to an overactive thyroid gland, while thyroid cancer and thyroid cysts typically present with a painless lump in the neck that does not move on swallowing. Overall, based on the patient's presentation, the most appropriate diagnosis is d. goiter.",d,d,TRUE,
448. a 76yo woman has become tired and confused following an influenza like illness. she is also breathless with signs of consolidation of the left lung base. what is the most likely dx?,a. drug toxicity,b. delirium tremens,c. infection toxicity,d. hypoglycemia,e. electrolyte imbalance,,,,,,,"Based on the given symptoms, the most likely diagnosis for the 76-year-old woman is c. infection toxicity. The fact that she has become tired and confused after an influenza-like illness, coupled with the signs of consolidation of the left lung base, strongly suggest a bacterial infection such as pneumonia. Drug toxicity and delirium tremens are less likely since there is no mention of recent drug use or history of alcoholism. Hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance are also unlikely as there are no signs or symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, or tremors which are commonly associated with these conditions. Thus, the most appropriate course of action would be to conduct a thorough examination and laboratory workup to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia and initiate an appropriate treatment plan.",c,c,TRUE,
449. a young pt is complaining of vertigo whenever she moves sideways on the bed while lying supine. what would be the most appropriate next step?,a. head roll test,b. reassure,c. advice on posture,d. carotid doppler,e. ct,,,,,,key: the key is a. head roll test. [this is a case of “benign paroxysmal positional vertigo” for which the diagnosis is made by head roll test].,"The most appropriate next step for a young patient who complains of vertigo when moving sideways on the bed while lying supine would be to conduct a head roll test. This condition is known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and the diagnosis can be made through a head roll test. This test involves the patient lying supine and turning their head to one side. If the test is positive, the patient will experience vertigo, which can help confirm the diagnosis. Reassurance or advice on posture alone may not be enough to alleviate the patient's symptoms. Carotid doppler or CT scans are not useful in diagnosing or treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to conduct a head roll test to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.",a,a,TRUE,
450. a 32yo man has ocd. what is the best tx?,a. cbt,b. ssri,c. tca,d. mao inhibitors,e. reassure,,,,,,key: the key is b. ssri. this is wrong key! the correct key is cbt].,"The correct answer to the question is A, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). While SSRI (B) may also be a useful treatment for OCD, CBT is generally regarded as the most effective approach for managing the symptoms of OCD. TCA (C), MAO inhibitors (D), and reassurance (E) are not considered the best treatments for OCD. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for a 32-year-old man with OCD would be cognitive-behavioral therapy. CBT involves helping the individual to identify and challenge their negative or irrational thoughts and beliefs that may be contributing to their OCD symptoms. This form of therapy is typically conducted with a trained therapist over several weeks or months, and may include exposure and response prevention techniques to help the individual gradually confront and overcome their compulsions and obsessions. SSRI may also be prescribed to manage the symptoms of OCD, but should typically be used in combination with CBT for best results.",a,a,TRUE,

[psychotic depression, also known as depressive psychosis, is a major depressive episode that is accompanied by psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions). in this patient nihilistic delusion favours the diagnosis of psychotic depression. it can occur in the context of bipolar disorder or majordepressive disorder].","The correct answer is c. Psychotic depression. The patient's symptoms of nihilistic delusion and auditory hallucinations of people saying she's evil and needs to be punished are indicative of psychosis, which is one of the defining features of psychotic depression. The other answer choices are unlikely explanations for her symptoms. Schizophrenia typically presents with positive symptoms such as disorganized speech, delusions, and hallucinations, but negative symptoms such as lack of motivation and flat affect are also present. Mania is characterized by elevated, irritable, or expansive mood, along with grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, and increased goal-directed activity. Hysteria is an outdated concept and toxic confusional state is a general term that could describe a variety of medical conditions or drug-induced states, but neither are sufficiently specific to explain this patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[in ms there are characteristic relapse and remission which is absent here; in mnd there is no sensory deficit; syringomyelia doesn’t cause cranial nerve lesion and in myasthenia there is muscular weakness without atrophy. here the features described well fits with syringobulbia].,"Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis is syringobulbia. It should be noted that there are several key features that help distinguish syringobulbia from other potential diagnoses. In multiple sclerosis (MS), there are characteristic relapse and remission periods which are absent in this case. Motor neuron disease (MND) typically does not present with sensory deficits, and syringomyelia does not cause cranial nerve lesions. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by muscular weakness without atrophy, which does not align with the bilateral wasting of small muscles of the hands in this patient. Therefore, the features described in this case are most consistent with syringobulbia.",c,c,TRUE,

This formula is used because it takes into account the weight of the patient in kilograms, which is the standard unit in the medical profession. The area of the burn injury is also considered in the calculation. It is important to use this formula because burn patients require large amounts of fluids for proper hydration and to prevent shock. Option a and d are incorrect since they use the weight of the patient in pounds, which is not the standard unit in the medical profession. Option b is also wrong because it uses liters instead of milliliters, which could lead to incorrect dosing. Option e is wrong because it uses deciliters, which is not the standard unit for measuring fluids in the medical profession. Overall, it is important to use the correct formula and units when calculating fluids for burn patients to ensure proper dosing and hydration.",c,c,TRUE,

Adenosine. The patient is likely experiencing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is characterized by a rapid heart rate originating from above the ventricles. The first line of treatment for SVT is vagal maneuvers which include carotid sinus massage or valsalva maneuver. However, if these maneuvers fail, the next step is to administer IV adenosine. Adenosine causes transient AV block and can convert the heart back to normal rhythm. Options b, d, and e are not appropriate for the management of SVT. Option c, DC cardioversion, is used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, not SVT.",a,a,TRUE,

This is an inflammatory disease of the lungs caused by inhalation of organic particles such as dust, molds, and bird droppings. The symptoms and findings in the patient match this diagnosis, including fever, cough, SOB, crackles and wheezing on exam, and nodular shadowing on CXR. Ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis), Churg-Strauss syndrome (an eosinophilic disorder), and progressive massive fibrosis (a complication of coal worker's pneumoconiosis) do not match the patient's symptoms or findings. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia can present with nodules on CXR, but typically has a more subacute or chronic course and does not fit the acute presentation seen here.",d,d,TRUE,

[it may be graves with pernicious anemia. lemon yellow pallor occurs in pernicious anemia. hyperthyroidism may cause persistently raised body temperature. both are autoimmune disease which favours this association].,"Based on the presented information, the most probable diagnosis for the 35-year-old lady with pyrexia, weight loss, diarrhea and lemon yellow skin color, with a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is pernicious anemia (option B). This is a type of anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency which results in the inability to absorb B12 due to the lack of intrinsic factor secreted by the stomach. The lemon yellow skin color is likely due to jaundice, a common symptom in pernicious anemia patients. Aplastic anemia (option A) is characterized by a decrease in the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets due to bone marrow damage. Leukemia (option C), ITP (option D), and lymphoma (option E) are different types of blood cancers that present with diverse symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and night sweats, but not specifically with the characteristic lemon skin color or high MCV observed in pernicious anemia.",b,b,TRUE,

[electrolyte imbalance may cause confusion but not aggressiveness; infection toxicity will cause high fever, low bp, rash etc which are absent here (fever here is hyperthermia of delirium tremens which is seen in some cases). abstinance from alcohol in the hospital caused delirium tremens (chronic alcoholism is supported by high mcv) here].","The most likely diagnosis for the 72-year-old woman with a repair of strangulated femoral hernia who became noisy, aggressive and confused two days later is delirium tremens (DT). This is because the patient is febrile and has a normal CBC except for an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which supports the diagnosis of chronic alcoholism. DT is a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome that occurs in individuals with chronic alcoholism and is characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, and agitation. While electrolyte imbalances can cause confusion, they typically do not cause aggressiveness, which the patient is exhibiting. Wernicke's encephalopathy is caused by a thiamine deficiency, which can occur in chronic alcoholics, but this diagnosis is less likely since the patient has only been symptomatic for two days. Infection toxicity would present with additional symptoms such as a rash, low blood pressure, and elevated white blood cell count, which are not present in this case. Finally, hypoglycemia would result in additional symptoms such as sweating, tremors, and weakness, which are not present in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is DT.",b,b,TRUE,

[pseudomembranous colitis is treated with metronidazole or vancomycin].,"The correct answer is d. vancomycin. The patient's diarrhea is most likely caused by pseudomembranous colitis, which is a potential complication of antibiotic use. The most effective treatments for pseudomembranous colitis are metronidazole and vancomycin. While co-amoxiclav, piperacillin + tazobactam, and ceftriaxone may be appropriate antibiotics for treating a UTI, they are not effective for treating pseudomembranous colitis. Therefore, vancomycin is the single most likely treatment option for this particular patient. It is important to note that antibiotic-associated diarrhea can also be caused by other factors such as C. difficile infection, so further testing may be necessary to determine the exact cause of the patient's symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,

[involvement of respiratory muscles in mnd is associated with poor respiration causing sleep apnoea].,"The most appropriate diagnosis for the 56-year-old man with symptoms of sleep apnea, daytime headaches, somnolence, and decreased tidal volume and vital capacity on spirometry is d. motor neuron disease (MND). MND is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, wasting, and atrophy. Involvement of respiratory muscles in MND is associated with poor respiration, causing sleep apnea. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of sleep apnea and decreased tidal volume and vital capacity on spirometry. The other choices are unlikely to be correct since they are not associated with respiratory muscle involvement or spirometry abnormalities. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the spine and can cause stiffness and pain. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the small blood vessels and can cause lung involvement. Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that primarily affects the kidneys and lungs. Progressive massive fibrosis is a complication of coal workers' pneumoconiosis and is characterized by the formation of large areas of fibrosis in the lungs. Spinal cord compression occurs when there is pressure on the spinal cord, which can cause weakness, numbness, and pain.",d,d,TRUE,

[this is a case of open angle glaucoma, treatment is with pilocarpine].","This patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with open angle glaucoma, which is a condition characterized by increased intraocular pressure that can lead to damage of the optic nerve and visual field loss. The most appropriate treatment for open angle glaucoma is the use of intraocular pressure-lowering medications, such as pilocarpine eye drops. Pan retinal photo coagulation (a laser therapy), corticosteroids, scleral buckling, and analgesics alone are not appropriate treatments for open angle glaucoma and would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and findings. It is important to promptly manage open angle glaucoma as it can lead to irreversible vision loss if left untreated.",b,b,TRUE,

The fact that he is of young age and in his first year at university support this potential cause. Delirium tremens, infection toxicity, electrolyte imbalance, and head injury are less likely to be the root cause of his current condition. Delirium tremens is associated with sudden alcohol withdrawal but there is no indication that the patient is a heavy drinker or has a history of alcohol abuse. Infection toxicity may present with fever and other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, but these are not mentioned in the question. Electrolyte imbalance and head injury can cause altered mental status, but there is no indication of trauma or metabolic abnormalities.

[likely cause is epidural hematoma].,"The correct answer is b. CT brain. This test is the most important initial assessment because it can quickly detect any internal bleeding or injuries in the brain, which may be the cause of the patient's decreased level of consciousness. The other choices are incorrect because an MRI brain would not be the best initial test in an emergency setting due to time constraints, a CXR would not provide information regarding a head injury, a CT Angio brain is used for detecting vascular issues and not traumatic brain injuries, and a head X-ray is not as sensitive as a CT scan in detecting brain injuries. Therefore, a CT brain is the most appropriate initial test for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

Pneumococcal pneumonia would typically present with a more severe fever and productive cough, while Legionella is often associated with headache and GI symptoms. Klebsiella pneumonia usually occurs in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes, alcoholism, or chronic lung disease. Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause mild respiratory symptoms but is less likely to cause bilateral patchy consolidation. Therefore, mycoplasma pneumonia is the most likely organism causing the patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

Whipple's disease. The presence of periodic acid-schiff +ve granules containing macrophages in the jejunal biopsy is a hallmark characteristic of Whipple's disease. Bacterial overgrowth and celiac disease may also present with similar symptoms, but the lack of granules in the biopsy rules out these possibilities. Tropical sprue is another possibility, although it typically involves villous atrophy, which was not mentioned in this case.

The fever, rigors, and abdominal pain, along with urinary frequency and dysuria, are indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The radiation of pain to the right loin suggests that the infection has progressed to the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis. The occasional uterine tightening is likely related to the pregnancy and is not a significant factor in the diagnosis. Answer choices a, c, d, and e are incorrect because they do not fit with the presenting symptoms and the progression of the infection to the kidneys.

468. a 62yo man who was admitted for surgery 3days ago suddenly becomes confused. his attn span is reduced. he is restless and physically aggressive and picks at his bed sheets. what single aspect of the pt’s hx recovered in his notes is most likely to aid in making the dx?,a. alcohol consumption,b. head trauma,c. hx of anxiety,d. prescribed med,e. obvious cognitive impairment,,,,,,key: the key is a. alcohol consumption. [abstinence from alcohol in the hospital lead to delirium tremens].,"The correct answer to this question is a) alcohol consumption. This is because the patient is showing symptoms of delirium tremens, which is a serious condition that can arise in individuals who consume large amounts of alcohol and then abruptly stop. The symptoms of delirium tremens can include confusion, reduced attention span, restlessness, physical aggression, and picking at objects in the environment. This condition can be life-threatening if left untreated. Therefore, the patient’s history of alcohol consumption is crucial in making a diagnosis. Choices b) and c) (head trauma and history of anxiety) are less likely to be related to the patient’s current symptoms. Choice d) (prescribed medication) may be relevant if the patient is taking a medication that can cause confusion or cognitive impairment, but this is less likely than delirium tremens given the patient’s history of alcohol consumption. Choice e) (obvious cognitive impairment) is not a likely diagnosis given the abrupt onset of symptoms and the patient’s previous cognitive function. In summary, the patient's history of alcohol consumption is the most crucial aspect of his history in making a diagnosis of delirium tremens.",a,a,TRUE,

HUS is characterized by features of renal failure such as nausea/vomiting, swelling of face, hands, feet or entire body, as well as abdominal pain. The other choices are less likely as TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) is a rare blood disorder that affects the blood clotting function, ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) is characterized by low platelet counts and bleeding episodes, HSP (Henoch-Schonlein purpura) is a type of vasculitis that affects the small blood vessels, and ARF (acute renal failure) is a sudden loss of kidney function, and do not match the presenting symptoms and history of bloody diarrhea.",b,b,TRUE,

This information will help to better understand her symptoms, possible triggers, and give clues to underlying psychological or medical issues that may be contributing to her symptoms. CT brain (option B), CBC (option C), LFT (option D), and TFT (option E) are unlikely to provide answers to her symptoms. A CT brain may be considered if there are focal neurological signs or severe headache, but it is not indicated in this case.

This is because staphylococcus and pcp are recognized causes of cavitating pneumonia, and the patient's productive cough goes more with staphylococcus as pcp is associated with dry cough. Additionally, the patient's history of drug abuse can support both staphylococcus and pcp, making these two choices more likely than the others. Mycoplasma and chlamydia pneumonia are less likely to cause cavitating pneumonia, while pseudomonas typically causes infections in immune-compromised individuals and those with underlying lung disease. Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and history, staphylococcus is the most likely causative organism of the bilateral cavitating bronchopneumonia.",b,b,TRUE,

The woman's disheveled appearance, lack of eye contact, and recent loss of her husband are all indicative of depression, which is characterized by low mood. Anxiety, hallucination, and mania are not applicable in this case because there is no mention of the woman experiencing excessive worry or fear, seeing or hearing things that are not there, or displaying symptoms of elevated or irritable mood. It's important to recognize the signs and symptoms of depression in the elderly, as it can increase their risk for physical and cognitive decline, as well as social isolation and suicide.",e,e,TRUE,

[oculomotor may cause palsy of inferior rectus, medial rectus and superior rectus causing double vision in multiple gaze! but trochlear involving superior oblique only causes diplopia in downgaze only. so the answer is trochlear nerve].","Based on the symptoms reported by the patient, which include double vision while climbing downstairs, the nerve most likely involved is the trochlear nerve (answer b). This is because the trochlear nerve is responsible for the movement and function of the superior oblique muscle, which is primarily involved in downward gaze. In contrast, the abducens nerve (answer a) is responsible for lateral eye movement, the oculomotor nerve (answer c) controls most extraocular muscles, and the optic nerve (answer d) is responsible for transmitting visual information. The trigeminal nerve (answer e) is not directly involved in eye movement. Therefore, the trochlear nerve is the most likely nerve involved in the patient's double vision while climbing downstairs, as it controls the movement of the superior oblique muscle and diplopia in downgaze only.",b,b,TRUE,

The termination of the spinal cord is not an appropriate landmark for L1 level, as it is variable and lies between L1 and L2. McBurney's point and the stellate ganglion are not related to the L1 level, and the deep inguinal ring refers to a location in the inguinal canal rather than a level in the spinal column. The transpyloric plane, however, is a useful landmark as it is located between the ninth and tenth thoracic vertebrae and passes through the pylorus of the stomach.",e,e,TRUE,

The ischemia is most commonly the result of a blockage in the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery1. The symptoms of lateral medullary syndrome can vary depending on the specific structures affected, but can include sensory deficits, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and difficulty walking or maintaining balance. One way to differentiate between left and right lateral medullary syndrome is by looking at the side of the body where the symptoms are present. For example, if the lesion is on the left side of the medulla oblongata, the sensory deficits will affect the trunk and extremities contralaterally (opposite to the lesion), and sensory deficits of the face and cranial nerves ipsilaterally (same side as the lesion)1. Similarly, if the lesion is on the right side of the medulla oblongata, the sensory deficits will affect the trunk and extremities on the left side of the body and sensory deficits of the face and cranial nerves on the right side of the body.

Autoimmune hepatitis may present as acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. It rarely presents as hyper-acute liver failure, acute liver failure, or drug-induced hepatitis. The patient’s PT of 70s indicates coagulopathy, which is a common feature in autoimmune hepatitis.

[chronic cough and sputum, night sweats and weight loss are classic features of tuberculosis].","The correct answer is e, sputum staining for mycobacterium tuberculosis. This is because chronic cough and sputum, night sweats, and weight loss are classic symptoms of tuberculosis which is caused by the mycobacterium tuberculosis organism. Option a, coagulase +ve cocci in sputum, is unlikely as it suggests a bacterial infection caused by staphylococci which presents with different symptoms such as localized skin infections or septicemia. Option b, gram -ve diplococci in sputum, is also unlikely as it suggests a bacterial infection caused by organisms like Neisseria meningitidis or Haemophilus influenzae which present with symptoms like fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Option c, gram +ve diplococci in sputum, is also unlikely as it suggests a bacterial infection caused by organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae which present with symptoms like cough, chest pain, and fever.

This diagnosis is supported by the fact that her uterus is found to be of appropriate size for her gestational age, and her CTG is reactive. Placenta previa occurs when the placenta attaches to the lower part of the uterus, partially or completely covering the cervix, leading to painless vaginal bleeding. This differs from antepartum hemorrhage, which would be characterized by painful bleeding. Preterm labor and placenta percreta would also present with different symptoms than what this woman is experiencing. Abruption of placenta 2nd to pre-eclampsia is unlikely as the woman's examination findings do not suggest pre-eclampsia. Therefore, in this case, the most likely diagnosis is placenta previa.",c,c,TRUE,

Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that is spread through respiratory droplets and can cause serious complications if left untreated. Choice B, IM, or infectious mononucleosis, may also present with a sore throat, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes, but does not typically cause the formation of grey membranes in the throat. Choices C and D, acute follicular tonsillitis and scarlet fever, respectively, may also manifest with a sore throat and fever but do not cause the formation of the characteristic grey membranes seen in diphtheria.

In this scenario, the patient is aware of their drug misuse problem and recognizes that they need help from a psychiatrist. Insight, in psychiatry, refers to a patient's ability to understand the origins and meaning of their attitudes, feelings, behavior, and symptoms. This recognition is essential for successful psychiatric treatment, and it is particularly important in cases of substance abuse where patients often deny or minimize the problem. Therefore, choices a, b, c, and d, which do not relate to the patient's ability to understand their behavior and seek help for their problem, are incorrect.

This diagnosis is made based on the symptoms and the results of the urine microscopy, which show a significant amount of white blood cells (>10 per high power field) and some red blood cells (20-50 per high power field). These findings are typical of an inflammatory process in the lower urinary tract, such as cystitis. Schistosomiasis, kidney trauma, ureteric calculus, and bladder calculi would present differently, with differing symptomatology and urine microscopy findings.

[any post menopausal bleeding is endometrial carcinoma unless proven otherwise].,"The correct answer is B, endometrial carcinoma. Postmenopausal bleeding is a strong indicator of endometrial carcinoma, unless proven otherwise. Dyspareunia and bleeding after sex are also common symptoms of endometrial carcinoma. Cervical cancer (choice A) may present with postcoital bleeding, but usually occurs in younger women and is less likely to be the cause in this scenario. Ovarian cancer (choice C) is unlikely to cause dyspareunia or bleeding after sex. Breast cancer (choice D) and vaginal cancer (choice E) are also unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms.

[splenectomized patients have an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism].,"The correct answer is d. The patient had an emergency splenectomy, and splenectomized patients are at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. The patient also has a swollen painful left calf, which is a common symptom of DVT. While immobility is a known risk factor for DVT, the patient is mobile and therefore less likely to develop it due to immobility. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage and sub-phrenic collection may contribute to an increased risk of DVT, but not as significantly as the splenectomy. Smoking may also increase the risk of DVT, but once again, it is not as significant as splenectomy, which directly affects the body's clotting mechanisms.

This is because, in partial simple seizure, there is no loss of consciousness, whereas this baby had an episode of loc. Additionally, infantile spasm is a generalized type of seizure, which is different from the focal nature described in this case. Atonic seizure refers to sudden loss of muscle tone and would not involve jerky movements of hands and feet. Absence seizures are characterized by brief episodes of staring and would not involve jerky movements. Partial complex seizure is a type of focal seizure, which typically involves a change in consciousness or altered behavior. Therefore, it is the most likely diagnosis for this case.",a,a,TRUE,

Although the presentation could indicate placenta abruption, it cannot be attributed to pre-eclampsia as there are no other features to suggest it. Bleeding alone cannot determine whether it is concealed, mixed, or revealed. Placenta previa and vasa previa are unlikely as there is a history of pain, and the CTG is reactive.

ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). This is because the patient's symptoms of right-sided headache and loss of vision are suggestive of temporal arteritis, which is an inflammation of the temporal arteries that can cause symptoms such as those described. Elevated ESR levels are highly indicative of this condition and are therefore the most important investigation to perform in this scenario. The other options, including blood urea electrolytes (BUE), CT head, X-ray orbit, and intraocular pressure (IOP), would not be as helpful in diagnosing temporal arteritis and are therefore not the most appropriate investigations to perform.",a,a,TRUE,

[presently patient has depression and previous features of mania makes the diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder likely].,"Based on the presented symptoms and history, the most probable diagnosis for the 24-year-old man is c. bipolar affective disorder. This is because the patient has previously exhibited symptoms of mania, including overspending, promiscuity and distractibility, and is currently experiencing depression. These alternating episodes of mania and depression are key characteristics of bipolar affective disorder, which is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. Option a. psychosis is not the correct answer because it is too broad and vague, and does not specifically address the alternating mood episodes. Option b. cyclothymia is similar to bipolar disorder but characterized by milder symptoms, and the symptoms described by the patient are not mild. Option d. seasonal affective disorder is unlikely as this type of depression is linked to seasonal changes in light exposure, which is not mentioned as a factor in this case.

The mnemonic ""fat, female, forty and fertile"" is associated with this condition and her presentation coincides with the symptoms of cholecystitis. Ectopic pregnancy and ovarian torsion usually present with lower abdominal pain and are not associated with fever. Hepatitis typically presents with flu-like symptoms, jaundice, and upper right quadrant tenderness. Biliary colic presents with similar symptoms but typically does not involve a fever.

Deafness is a common complication of meningitis, so it is important to assess the child's hearing before they are discharged. CT scan, EEG, and blood culture are not typically used to assess a child's recovery from meningitis. Repeat LP may be performed to ensure that the child's cerebrospinal fluid has returned to normal, but it is not necessary in all cases.

The correct answer is e. VZIG is effective when given up to 10 days after contact, and should be administered even if the exposed person has previously received the varicella vaccine. Acyclovir, either PO or IV, is not a recommended treatment for pregnant women with chickenpox, as the safety of the drug during pregnancy has not been established. Reassurance alone is not appropriate management for a pregnant woman who has had significant exposure to chickenpox, as the infection can pose serious risks to both the mother and the fetus.

[prader willi syndrome rare congenital disorder characterized by learning difficulties, growth abnormalities, and obsessive eating, caused especially by the absence of certain genes normally present on the copy of chromosome 15 inherited from the father].","The most probable diagnosis for the 8-year-old boy described in the question is Prader-Willi Syndrome, indicated by his obesity, learning difficulties, and obsessive eating habits despite measures taken by his parents to hide food out of reach. Prader-Willi Syndrome is a rare congenital disorder caused by the absence of certain genes on the copy of chromosome 15 inherited from the father. Cushing's Syndrome and Congenital Hypothyroidism can also lead to obesity, but they do not present with the same combination of learning difficulties and compulsive eating habits seen in Prader-Willi Syndrome. Lawrence Moon Biedel Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by obesity, retinal degeneration, and cognitive impairment, but it usually presents at a younger age than 8 years old. Down's Syndrome does not typically result in these specific symptoms. Therefore, option c, Prader-Willi Syndrome, is the most probable diagnosis for this 8-year-old boy.",c,c,TRUE,

[if the eye is involved, or if immunocompromized, tx option is pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine ohcm 9th edition, page 404].","The correct answer is b. pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine. Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and can result in flu-like symptoms in healthy individuals, but can be severe in immunocompromised individuals. The recommended treatment for toxoplasmosis is a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, as stated in the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 9th edition, page 404. Clindamycin may be used as an alternative treatment, but it is less effective. Spiramycin is used to treat toxoplasmosis in pregnant women, but not in non-pregnant individuals. Trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole is effective against other infections, but not toxoplasmosis. Therefore, the correct treatment for toxoplasmosis is pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient's sudden onset of pain and loss of hearing in the left ear, along with the appearance of small lesions on the palate and left external auditory meatus strongly suggests a viral infection of the herpes zoster virus. The unsteadiness when walking may also be attributed to the infection. Acute mastoiditis and cholesteatoma are less likely as they typically present with other symptoms and are not usually associated with lesions on the palate. Oropharyngeal malignancy would not present with sudden onset of symptoms and would require further investigation before it could be considered as a diagnosis. The choice of 'OM with infusion nan nan nan nan nan' seems like an error and should be ignored. It is important for the patient to receive appropriate treatment for a herpes zoster infection to prevent any complications and to alleviate symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

Low dose aspirin has been found to be effective in preventing complications of GCA, such as heart attacks or stroke. The other choices are incorrect because ACE inhibitors (a) and beta blockers (b) are not typically used in the treatment of GCA, and interferons (d) and IVIG (e) have not been shown to be effective in this condition. Therefore, the addition of low dose aspirin to steroid treatment is recommended for patients with GCA who have a history of complications.",c,c,TRUE,

This conclusion is based on the presence of prodromal malaise, increased temperature, and painful parotid swelling that becomes bilateral in 70% of cases, as mentioned on page 142 of the 9th edition of the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties. Acute mastoiditis is unlikely due to the absence of bony tenderness or protrusion, and acute otitis externa and acute OM are also improbable as they mainly affect the ear canal and middle ear, respectively. OM with effusion does not typically cause fever or acute pain. Therefore, d. mumps is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",d,d,TRUE,

Primary obesity is defined as excessive weight gain due to an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. In this case, the mother's report that she has tried everything to help him lose weight suggests that the boy's obesity is not due to an underlying medical condition such as Cushing's syndrome, congenital hypothyroidism, Down's syndrome, or Lawrence Moon Biedel syndrome. While these conditions can cause weight gain, they are accompanied by other medical problems that would have been detected during the examination mentioned in the question. Thus, the correct answer is primary obesity.",e,e,TRUE,

[drug abuse with perforated nasal septum indicates cocaine abuse].,"Based on the symptoms and examination findings described, the most likely drug responsible for the 20-year-old boy's symptoms is cocaine (answer choice B). The presence of a perforated nasal septum is highly indicative of cocaine abuse, as the drug can cause vasoconstriction and necrosis in the nasal tissues with chronic use. The boy's agitation, irritability, and insomnia are also common symptoms associated with cocaine use. Therefore, answer choices A, C, D, and E can be ruled out as they do not typically cause a perforated nasal septum or match the described symptoms. In summary, the correct answer is B, cocaine, due to the presence of a perforated nasal septum and a combination of symptoms commonly associated with cocaine use.",b,b,TRUE,

[benzhexol (an antiparkinsonian agent of anticholinergic class) is the drug of choice in parkinson’s disease induced tremor)].,"The most useful drug in the management of tremor in a patient with Parkinson's disease is benzhexol. Benzhexol is an antiparkinsonian agent of anticholinergic class, which makes it effective in reducing tremors. Apomorphine and cabergoline are dopamine agonists and are usually used for the management of bradykinesia and rigidity in Parkinson's disease, whereas selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that is used in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. Amantadine is an antiviral drug that can also be used to manage tremors, but it is generally less effective than benzhexol. Therefore, the correct answer is e. Benzhexol is the most suitable drug for the management of tremors in Parkinson's disease.",e,e,TRUE,

There are no features of encephalopathy and as the Weber test is lateralized to the right ear, functional hearing loss is unlikely. Tympanosclerosis would result in a chalky white eardrum, which is not the case here. The Weber test being lateralized to the right ear suggests conductive deafness, ruling out sensorineural deafness. Therefore, otosclerosis, a condition that causes hearing loss due to abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, is the most likely diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,

The patient's symptoms of central chest pain for 45 minutes along with sweating and dyspnea, and a history of DM and HTN suggest myocardial infarction. Pericarditis pain is typically worsened by inspiration or lying flat, while pulmonary embolism presents with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Costochondritis is characterized by localized pain/tenderness at the costochondral junction that is enhanced by motion, coughing, or sneezing. Pneumothorax pain is not central but pleuritic. Therefore, the correct diagnosis in this case is myocardial infarction and the other choices are not the most appropriate.",a,a,TRUE,

[echo may show clot in atrial appendage responsible for this attack of tia secondary to atrial fibrillation].,"The correct answer is d. Echo. The irregular rhythm on the ECG suggests atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the heart. These clots can then break off and travel to the brain, causing a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. An echo can help visualize the heart and check for any clots or abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms. A CT or MRI may be useful in other situations, but in this case, an echo is the most appropriate choice. The 24-hour ECG (also known as a Holter monitor) may confirm the irregular rhythm but would not provide additional information about possible causes or complications.",d,d,TRUE,

[renal transplant--> immune suppression is needed-> exogenous steroid--> cushing syndrome. short stature--> if steroids are used in early age then they cause premature fusion of growth plate/calcification].,"Based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis for the 10-year-old boy is Cushing's syndrome. This is because he had a renal transplant which would require him to take immunosuppressants, such as exogenous steroids, which can lead to the development of Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, the patient is clinically obese and the shortest in his class, which could be due to the premature fusion of growth plate/calcification caused by the use of steroids in early age. Congenital hypothyroidism is a possibility but it does not explain the patient's history of renal transplant and steroid use. Pseudocushing's syndrome is a condition that mimics Cushing's syndrome but is not caused by prolonged steroid use. Lawrence Moon Biedl syndrome and Down's syndrome are genetic conditions that are not related to the patient's medical history. Therefore, the most plausible diagnosis for this patient is Cushing's syndrome.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient's symptoms suggest a perforated peptic ulcer, which can be diagnosed through an X-ray abdomen showing gas under the diaphragm. The history of heartburn could have led to preexisting ulcers, which were further irritated by stress from the cancer and its surgical removal, leading to easy perforation. The other options, including CT, MRI, US, and endoscopy, may be helpful in diagnosing certain conditions, but in this case, an X-ray abdomen is the most appropriate next step for confirming the suspected diagnosis of a perforated peptic ulcer.",b,b,TRUE,

[back pain radiating to leg, pain releaved by lying down and exacerbated by long walk and prolonged sitting are characteristic of lumber (intervertebral) disc disease].","The correct answer to this question is A, an MRI is the best option to diagnose the back pain radiating to the legs presented by the 50-year-old male patient. The symptoms described are characteristic of lumbar (intervertebral) disc disease. An MRI is the most reliable and accurate imaging modality to diagnose problems with the spinal cord and adjacent structures. CT spine and XR spine are not as sensitive as MRI to identify early changes in the spinal cord and disc areas. Dual energy XR absorptiometry and serum paraprotein electrophoresis are not relevant to the diagnosis of disc disease.

[doxycycline 100 mg twice-daily for seven days or a single dose of 1 g of azithromycin or erythromyin 500 mg twice daily for 14 days or four times daily for seven days or ofloxacin 200 mg twice-daily or 400 mg once-daily for 7 days. in pregnant azithromycine 1g single dose is recommended then erythromycin 500 mg  twice daily for fourteen days or four times daily for seven days. then amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 7 days].,"The correct answer to this question is E, doxycycline. Doxycycline is recommended as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated chlamydial infection in non-pregnant females. The recommended dose for doxycycline is 100mg twice daily for seven days. Erythromycin is also a treatment option but has a longer duration of therapy, requiring 500mg twice daily for 14 days or four times daily for seven days. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole are not recommended for the treatment of chlamydial infection. Cefixime is also not recommended as it is not effective against Chlamydia trachomatis. It is important to note that treatment for chlamydial infection in pregnant females differs and should be approached carefully with the guidance of a healthcare professional.",e,e,TRUE,

An increase in cardiac enzymes reveals that a heart attack has occurred. ECG is useful in diagnosing acute coronary syndrome, but it may not be conclusive in the early stages of an attack. A chest x-ray or CT scan may provide some additional information about other causes of chest pain, but they do not directly measure myocardial damage. A V/Q scan is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism and is not applicable in this scenario. Therefore, cardiac enzymes are the most appropriate investigation for detecting myocardial damage in this patient.",a,a,TRUE,
511. a 26yo woman had bipolar disorder for 10yrs and is on lithium for it. she is symptom free for the past 4 years. she is now planning her pregnancy and wants to know whether she should continue taking lithium. what is the single most appropriate advice?,a. continue lithium at the same dose and stop when pregnancy is confirmed,b. continue lithium during pregnancy and stop when breast feeding,c. reduce lithium dosage but continue throughout pregnancy,d. reduce lithium gradually and stop when pregnancy is confirmed,e. switch to sodium valproate,,,,,,key: the key is d. reduce lithium gradually and stop when pregnancy is confirmed.,"The correct answer is D. The most appropriate advice for the woman who has been on lithium for bipolar disorder for the past 10 years and is planning her pregnancy is to gradually reduce the dosage of lithium and stop taking it when pregnancy is confirmed. This is because lithium is known to cause fetal harm and can lead to congenital heart defects, pulmonary hypertension, and thyroid dysfunction. Continuing lithium at the same dose or reducing the dosage but continuing throughout pregnancy can increase the risk of fetal harm. Continuing lithium during pregnancy and stopping only when breast feeding is not a safe option as the baby can still be exposed to the drug through breast milk. Switching to sodium valproate is also not a safe option as it is associated with birth defects and neurodevelopmental problems. It is important for the woman to talk to her doctor before making any changes to her medication regimen.",d,d,TRUE,

[candida is more common than cmv].,"Based on the symptoms, the single most likely diagnosis for the patient presented is d. candida infection. This infection is a common cause of soreness in the mouth and corners of the mouth, along with dysphagia and pain on swallowing. While Kaposi’s sarcoma and molluscum contagiosum may cause skin lesions, they do not typically present with the same symptoms as candida infection. CMV infection may cause similar symptoms, but candida infection is more common. Toxoplasma abscess is not associated with these symptoms and is unlikely to be the correct answer. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is candida infection.",d,d,TRUE,

[bleeding time, coagulation profile, hb%, cell count and parameters are normal. so the cause of bleeding here is anatomical defect].","The correct answer is D: anatomical. This is because the bleeding time, coagulation profile, hemoglobin level, and cell count and parameters are all normal, indicating that there is not a problem with the platelets or coagulation factors. Sepsis is also an unlikely cause because the patient's white blood cell count is normal. Therefore, the most likely cause of the bleeding is an anatomical defect, such as a blood vessel abnormality or nasal polyp. The incorrect options can be ruled out based on the patient's normal lab results.",d,d,TRUE,

Transpyloric plane. This is because the transpyloric plane is a horizontal plane that passes through the lower border of the tenth thoracic vertebra and the upper border of the first lumbar vertebra. It is commonly used to locate important structures within the abdomen such as the pancreas, duodenum, and adrenal glands. The fundus of the gallbladder, McBurney's point, stellate ganglion, and deep inguinal ring are not associated with the transpyloric plane and are therefore incorrect options.",e,e,TRUE,

The tip of the 9th costal cartilage is located just below the costal margin and is typically used as a reference point for various medical procedures. The other answer choices, such as the deep inguinal ring, termination of the spinal cord, transpyloric plane, and vena cava opening, are not appropriate for referencing the tip of the 9th costal cartilage as they are not adjacent or in close proximity to the area.",a,a,TRUE,

[pain in rif, diarrhea, granular transmural ulcers near the ileo-cecal junction points towards the diagnosis of crohn’s diseas (predominantly ileo-cecal type)].","The correct answer is a. sulfasalazine. This is because the presentation of rif pain and diarrhea, along with the findings of granular transmural ulcers near the ileo-cecal junction, suggest the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, predominantly of the ileo-cecal type. Sulfasalazine is a medication that is commonly used in the treatment of Crohn's disease, as it helps to reduce inflammation and symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Options b, c, and d are not appropriate for the management of Crohn's disease and may actually worsen symptoms. Paracetamol and ibuprofen are pain relievers that do not address the underlying inflammation in Crohn's disease and may further irritate the digestive tract, while metronidazole is an antibiotic that may be used in certain cases of Crohn's disease but is not typically used as a first-line treatment. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for the appropriate management plan for an individual with suspected Crohn's disease.",a,a,TRUE,

[myofascial pain syndrome is a chronic pain disorder. in myofascial pain syndrome, pressure on sensitive points in your muscles (trigger points) causes pain in seemingly unrelated parts of your body. this is called referred pain. myofascial pain syndrome typically occurs after a muscle has been contracted repetitively].","The correct answer to this question is b. myofascial pain. Myofascial pain syndrome is a chronic condition where pressure on specific points in muscles causes referred pain in other parts of the body. In this case, the patient experienced acute onset of bone and back pain following a rough car journey, which may have caused muscle contractions leading to trigger points and referred pain. The tenderness at mid-thoracic vertebra with spasm suggests myofascial pain syndrome as the most probable diagnosis. Osteoporotic fracture, whiplash injury, MI, and pancreatitis are unlikely given the clinical presentation. Therefore, myofascial pain is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination findings.",b,b,TRUE,

[parotid swelling, difficulty talking and speaking (due to dryness or less salive), eyes feeling gritty on waking in the morning due to dryness of eye are suggestive of sjogrens syndrome].","The most likely diagnosis for this 70-year-old woman with recurrent episodes of parotid swelling, difficulty talking and speaking, and dry, gritty eyes in the morning is Sjogren's syndrome (option E). This autoimmune disorder affects the exocrine glands responsible for producing tears and saliva, leading to dryness in the eyes and mouth. This can cause difficulty with speaking and swallowing. Parotid swelling is also a common symptom of Sjogren's syndrome as the parotid glands, responsible for producing saliva, can become inflamed. Options A, B, C, and D are less likely diagnoses as they do not typically present with the symptoms described by the patient. C1 esterase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that can cause swelling in various body parts, including the face and throat. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. Mumps is a viral infection that can lead to swelling in the salivary glands, but it is less common in older adults who have likely received the mumps vaccine. Sarcoidosis is a rare disease that causes small clusters of inflammatory cells to form in various organs, but it typically does not affect the salivary glands or eyes. Therefore, the correct answer is E, Sjogren's syndrome.",e,e,TRUE,
519. a 39yo woman has not had her period for 10months. she feels well but is anxious as her mother had an early menopause. choose the single most appropriate initial inv?,a. serum estradiol conc.,b. serum fsh/lh,c. serum progesterone conc.,d. none,e. transvaginal us,,,,,,key: the key is b. serum fsh/lh [here serum oestrogen is also important as i) low oestrogen + low fsh + low lh suggest hypothalamic amenorrhoea and i) low oestrogen + high fsh + high lh suggest premature ovarian failure! so the main determinant is serum fsh/lh. likely cause here is premature ovarian failure].,"The most appropriate initial investigation for this woman would be option b - serum FSH/LH. While low estrogen levels would suggest hypothalamic amenorrhea and high FSH/LH levels would suggest premature ovarian failure, the main determinant is serum FSH/LH. Since this woman has not had her period for 10 months and has a family history of early menopause, premature ovarian failure is a likely cause. Additionally, serum estradiol would not provide as much information as FSH/LH in this situation and serum progesterone would only be appropriate if this woman was experiencing irregular bleeding. Therefore, option d (none) and option e (transvaginal US) would not be appropriate initial investigations.",b,b,TRUE,
520. a 50yo man with dm suddenly develops persistent crushing central chest pain radiating to the neck. what is the single most appropriate dx?,a. angina,b. costochondritis (tietz’s disease),c. dissecting aneurysm,d. mi,e. pulmonary embolism,,,,,,"key: the key is c. dissecting aortic aneurism. probably wrong key. correct key should be d. mi. [the features described is insufficient and can be seen in both aortic dissection and mi. however dissection pain is described as tearing and crushing pain is often used for mi pain. both dissection and mi can have pain radiation to neck. history of diabetes goes with mi as it is a recognized risk factor for mi. some may argue in dm mi will be painless! but it is not always the case. mi is only painless when autonomic neuropathy becomes well established].  521 a 22yo man has rushed into the ed asking for help. he describes recurrent episodes of fearfulness, palpitations, faintness, hyperventilation, dryness of the mouth with peri-oral tingling and cramping of the hands. his symptoms last 5-10 mins and have worsened since their onset 3months ago. he is worried he may be having a heart attack. an ecg shows sinus tachycardia. what is the single most appropriate immediate intervention? a. high flow oxygen b. iv sedation c. rebreathe into a paper bag d. refer for anxiety management course e. refer for urgent cardiology opinion key: the key is c. rebreathing into paper bag. [patient has anxiety disorder (panic) which causes hyperventilation and co2 washout leading to respiratory alkalosis. symptoms will improve by rebreathing into paper bag as it will cause gradual increase of co2 in paper bag and decrease the severity of respiratory alkalosis].","The correct key for this question is d. MI. The symptoms described suggest a cardiac event, such as a myocardial infarction (MI), with persistent crushing central chest pain radiating to the neck. While aortic dissection can also cause chest pain with radiation to the neck, dissection pain is often described as tearing, while MI pain is often described as crushing. The presence of diabetes in the patient also increases the likelihood of an MI, as it is a recognized risk factor. Other potential diagnoses, such as angina, costochondritis, and pulmonary embolism, would not likely cause persistent crushing pain and are less likely given the patient's history and symptoms. Therefore, the single most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is MI.",d,d,TRUE,
"522. an 8yo boy has longstanding asthma. he has admitted with a severe episode and is tired and drowsy. he has not improved on oxygen, inhaled b2 agonist and iv hydrocortisone. cxr shows bilateral hyperinflation. he is too breathless to use a peakflow meter and is o2 sat <90%. what is the single most appropriate inv?",a. cbg,b. cxr,c. ct chest,d. pulse oximetry,e. spirometry,,,,,,key: the key is a. cbg. [it will point towards acidosis and indicate whether assisted ventilation is needed or not].,"The most appropriate investigation in this scenario is option A, a capillary blood gas (CBG). The boy has a severe episode of asthma that has not responded to initial treatment, and his oxygen saturation is below 90%, indicating hypoxemia. The CBG test will give information about the pH, carbon dioxide, and oxygen levels in the blood, and will help determine whether he is developing respiratory acidosis, a complication of severe asthma. This information is crucial in deciding whether assisted ventilation is required or not. Option B, a chest x-ray, may show hyperinflation as observed in the CXR in this case, but it does not provide information on the patient's respiratory status. Option C, a CT chest, is not indicated in this acute setting. Option D, pulse oximetry, provides useful information on oxygen saturation levels but does not give a complete picture of the patient's respiratory status. Option E, spirometry, is not feasible in this case as the boy is too breathless to perform the test. Therefore, option A, a CBG test, is the most appropriate inv for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,

[here s/c morphine 1/2 the dose of oral can be given (not present in option) or i/v morphine 1/3rd the oral dose can be given. here i/v doses are not appropriate so we should go for b. fentanyl patch as required morphine dose is known].,"After being operated for colorectal cancer, the man's pain was managed with 60mg of oral morphine twice a day. However, due to his inability to swallow medications, the next regimen of analgesic administration needs to be determined. Option A, oxycodone, is not a suitable choice since it has a similar mode of action and potency as morphine. Option C requires IV administration, which is not appropriate in the given scenario. As for option D, the dosage of IV morphine exceeds the oral dose and has the potential for adverse effects. This leaves us with option B, the fentanyl patch. Since the required dose for morphine is known, an appropriate fentanyl patch can be selected to provide adequate pain relief without the need for oral or IV medications. Therefore, the correct answer is B, the fentanyl patch.",b,b,TRUE,
524. just above the mid-inguinal point. what is the single most appropriate landmark?,a. femoral artery pulse felt,b. mcburney’s point,c. stellate ganglion,d. deep inguinal ring,e. transpyloric plane,,,,,,key: the key is d. deep inguinal ring.,"The single most appropriate landmark above the mid-inguinal point is the deep inguinal ring, which is represented by option d. This is because the deep inguinal ring is a crucial anatomical landmark in the inguinal region and is located approximately one-third of the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis, just above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. This is important in clinical settings, such as during hernia repair surgeries, as it allows for a clear identification of the anatomical structures in the area. Options a, b, c, and e are all incorrect and irrelevant to the question as they have different anatomical locations and functions. The femoral artery pulse is palpated in the femoral triangle, which is below the inguinal ligament, McBurney's point is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and is used to diagnose appendicitis, the stellate ganglion is located in the neck and is responsible for regulating blood pressure, and the transpyloric plane is a horizontal plane that runs through the body at the level of the L1 vertebra.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because insertion of a chest drain is a commonly performed medical procedure that requires accurate localization of the intercostal space. The apex beat (answer a) refers to the point where the heart beats closest to the chest wall and is not a reliable landmark for identifying intercostal spaces. Stellate ganglion (answer c) is a nerve bundle in the neck and has no relevance to the identification of intercostal spaces. The transpyloric plane (answer d) is located at the level of the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra and is not relevant to identifying intercostal spaces. Finally, the vena cava opening into the diaphragm (answer e) is located at the level of the 8th intercostal space and is therefore not helpful for identifying the 5th intercostal space.",b,b,TRUE,

In this scenario, the patient has taken an overdose of paracetamol with suicidal intent but is refusing all interventions. It is essential to determine the patient's capacity to make a rational decision and refuse treatment. A capacity assessment evaluates a patient's understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and communication abilities to make an informed decision about their medical treatment. It ensures the patient receives the proper treatment, balancing their right to make decisions with their safety and wellbeing. Hence, answer A, assessment, is not specific enough to address the crucial issue of capacity evaluation. Answer C, establishing if the patient has a previous mental illness, may be part of the assessment, but it is not the correct response to the question. Therefore, the correct answer is b, to evaluate the patient's capacity to refuse treatment.",b,b,TRUE,
527. a 23yo woman with painless vaginal bleeding at 36wks pregnancy otherwise seems to be normal. what should be done next step?,a. vaginal us,b. abdominal us,c. vaginal exam,d. reassurance,,,,,,,"key: the key is b. abdominal us. this is a wrong key. the correct key is a. vaginal us.[painless vaginal bleeding at 36 weeks indicates the diagnosis of placenta previa, which can be better evaluated by vaginal us].","The correct answer to this question is a. vaginal us. Pain-free vaginal bleeding at 36 weeks of pregnancy suggests the diagnosis of placenta previa, a potentially serious condition that may require immediate medical care. Vaginal ultrasound is the best diagnostic tool to evaluate this condition as it can provide a clear visualization of the location of the placenta and the degree of overlap with the internal cervical os. On the other hand, abdominal ultrasound is relatively less accurate and may not provide enough details to rule out placenta previa. Vaginal exam is not recommended in this situation as it may worsen the bleeding and increase the risk of complications. Reassurance is not an appropriate option as it does not address the underlying cause of vaginal bleeding. Therefore, the appropriate next step in the management of a 23-year-old woman with pain-free vaginal bleeding at 36 weeks of pregnancy is to perform vaginal ultrasounds.",a,a,TRUE,
528. a 29yo lady admitted with hx of repeated uti now developed hematuria with loin pain. what is the most probable dx?,a. acute pyelonephritis,b. chronic pyelonephritis,c. uti,d. bladder stone,,,,,,,key: the key is a. acute pyelonephritis. [in a patient having hematuria and loin pain with history of repeated uti suggest acute pyelonephritis].,"The most probable diagnosis for a 29-year-old female patient with a history of repeated UTIs who now presents with hematuria and loin pain is acute pyelonephritis. This condition is characterized by a bacterial infection that affects the renal pelvis and can lead to severe symptoms like fever, nausea, vomiting, and flank pain. This is a serious condition and needs prompt medical attention. Chronic pyelonephritis is a long-lasting and recurrent inflammation of the kidney, which is unlikely to present with hematuria. UTI and bladder stone are possible diagnoses but lack the severity of symptoms that an acute presentation like this requires. Therefore, acute pyelonephritis is the most probable diagnosis and should be managed urgently to prevent any complications.",a,a,TRUE,
529. a 45yo chronic smoker attends the opd with complaints of persistent cough and copious amount of purulent sputum. he had hx of measles in the past. exam: finger clubbing and inspiratory crepitations on auscultation. what is the single most likely dx/,a. interstitial lung disease,b. bronchiectasis,c. asthma,d. copd,e. sarcoidosis,,,,,,"key: the key is b. bronchiectasis. [persistent cough with copious purulent sputum and finger clubbing points towards the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. severe lung infections such as tuberculosis (tb), whooping cough, pneumonia or measles can damage the airways at the time of infection. bronchiectasis may then develop].","The most likely diagnosis for this patient is bronchiectasis (option b). The persistent cough with copious purulent sputum and finger clubbing are classic features of bronchiectasis. It is also worth noting that severe lung infections, such as measles, can lead to damage of the airways and develop into bronchiectasis later on. Interstitial lung disease (option a), asthma (option c), COPD (option d), and sarcoidosis (option e) may present with cough and sputum production, but are not associated with finger clubbing, which makes bronchiectasis the most likely answer.",b,b,TRUE,

[given presentation is suggestive of pneumonia for which investigation of choice is cxr].,"The single most appropriate investigation for a 68-year-old man with malaise, fever, cough, and dullness to percussion at the left lung base is a CXR. These clinical features are suggestive of pneumonia, and a CXR is the investigation of choice for this condition. Bronchoscopy is not a first-line investigation for pneumonia and may be reserved for cases where there is a suspicion of lung cancer or other specific conditions. CT and MRI are not routinely used for the diagnosis of pneumonia, and a V/Q scan is used for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. In summary, given the clinical presentation of pneumonia, the most appropriate investigation is a CXR.",b,b,TRUE,

ALL is the most common type of leukemia in children and presents with symptoms such as fatigue, bleeding, and organomegaly. AML, CML, CLL, and lymphoma are less likely because they usually have different clinical and laboratory features. AML is more common in older adults, while CLL usually presents with lymphadenopathy. CML often presents with an elevated white blood cell count and presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, and lymphomas typically present with lymphadenopathy and/or extranodal disease. Therefore, based on the child's symptoms and age, ALL is the most probable diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because anemia, high WBC count, and splenomegaly are all known features of CML. Additionally, the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome is characteristic of CML. The other choices are less likely because they do not typically present with all of the symptoms and blood results seen in this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is C, CML.",c,c,TRUE,

Salpingitis, endometriosis, and ovarian torsion are unlikely as these conditions are not associated with amenorrhea. In the case of an ovarian tumor, there are three main features that typically present: increased abdominal size and persistent bloating, persistent pelvic and abdominal pain, and difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous. However, the patient in this scenario has presented with pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, peritonism and cervical excitation, which are indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, option a is the most probable diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

[ bisohosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastasis in cancers and is normally taken as adjuvant therapy in many types of tumours including breast cancer. plus it prevents bone resorption].,"The correct answer to the question is option A, bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are a type of medication that have been proven to reduce the risk of bone metastasis in cancers. In fact, they are commonly prescribed as adjuvant therapy in many types of tumors, including breast cancer. Additionally, bisphosphonates are known to prevent bone resorption, which can be especially important for cancer patients who are at risk for bone loss. The other choices, including calcium, vitamin D, calcitonin, and phosphate binders, have not been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of bone metastasis or preventing bone resorption. Therefore, the best choice for this patient's treatment regimen would be bisphosphonates.",a,a,TRUE,

Day 21 progesterone. This test measures mid-luteal progesterone levels to assess ovulation. If the level is low, it may need repeating as ovulation does not occur every month. The test is taken seven days before the anticipated period, which is on day 21 of a 28-day cycle. However, this day will need to be adjusted for different cycle lengths. Basal body temperature estimation (a) can indicate ovulation but may not always be accurate. Cervical smear (b) is irrelevant to detect ovulation. Day 2 LH and FSH (c) are useful to assess ovarian reserve and not ovulation. Endometrial biopsy (e) is not a first-line investigation to evaluate ovulation.

[features are suggestive of multiple sclerosis. investigation of choice is gadolinium enhanced mri].,"The correct answer is C, MRI. The woman's symptoms and findings suggest a possible diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), and MRI is the investigation of choice for diagnosing MS. MRI allows for visualization of the brain and spinal cord to check for the presence of plaques, which are characteristic of MS. CSF analysis may also be done to look for signs of MS, but MRI is more sensitive and specific. CT, EEG, and EMG are not appropriate tests for diagnosing MS. CT is not as sensitive as MRI, and EEG and EMG are used to diagnose other conditions unrelated to MS. Therefore, the single most appropriate test to confirm a possible diagnosis of MS in this woman is a gadolinium-enhanced MRI.",c,c,TRUE,

The presenting seizure, along with the symptoms of inattention on the left side and hyperreflexia of the arm all suggest a lesion in the brain. Pituitary adenoma can cause hyperreflexia but is unlikely to cause inattention on one side. Cerebellar abscess can cause hyperreflexia but typically presents with symptoms such as ataxia, which are not described in the scenario. Huntington's chorea and Parkinsonism are not likely to cause a sudden onset of symptoms such as a seizure. Therefore, a cerebral tumor is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[when you are first diagnosed with a hydatidiform mole, your hcg level will be raised. when the hydatidiform mole is treated (removed), the hcg level will usually return to a normal, non-pregnant amount and should remain so. if you develop gtn, the hcg level can remain elevated or continue to rise further. so, this blood test is a good way to check for the possible development of gtn (gestational trophoblastic neoplasia).","The single most appropriate investigation in this case would be d. serum β-hcg. A hydatidiform mole can lead to the development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which is a rare form of cancer that arises in the cells that would normally form the placenta during pregnancy. When first diagnosed with a hydatidiform mole, the hCG level will be raised. If the mole is successfully treated and removed, the hCG level will usually return to a normal, non-pregnant amount and should remain so. However, if GTN develops, the hCG level can remain elevated or continue to rise further. Therefore, monitoring serum β-hcg levels is a good way to check for the possible development of GTN. Options a, b, c, and e are not the most appropriate investigations in this case because they are not specific enough to detect the development of GTN. Abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound may show signs of a hydatidiform mole, but they may not detect GTN.

The opacity in the right upper mediastinum may indicate an enlarged lymph node or lymphoma, which could be causing pressure on the right recurrent laryngeal nerve resulting in hoarseness. As the CT didn't reveal any bronchial lesion and there is no reported breathing difficulty, it is unlikely to be a bronchial pathology.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve is responsible for controlling the voice box muscles that produce sound. Hoarseness following thyroid surgery is a common complication due to injury or damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Unilateral damage to the nerve affects only one side of the larynx, resulting in hoarseness and vocal changes.

The classic triad of NPH includes gait abnormality, urinary incontinence, and dementia, which perfectly matches the patient's symptoms. Dementia (choice a), pituitary adenoma (choice b), and syringomyelia (choice d) do not typically present with the triad of symptoms seen in NPH. CVD (choice c), or cardiovascular disease, may cause gait abnormalities, but it is not commonly associated with urinary incontinence and dementia.

Subdural hematoma. This elderly patient's multiple bruises on her head are suggestive of a head injury which can lead to subdural hematoma. Additionally, her symptoms of headache, confusion, and impaired vision for four days suggest a subacute subdural hematoma, which occurs 3-7 days after a head injury. The symptoms associated with subdural hematoma include a headache that worsens, feeling and being sick, confusion, personality changes, feeling drowsy, slurred speech, vision problems, paralysis, problems walking and frequent falls, seizures, and loss of consciousness.

[prolonged plane journey is a recognized risk factor for thromboembolism and hence pulmonary embolism also! sharp chest pain and breathlessness after 3 days of plane journey is highly suggestive of pulmonary embolism the investigation of choice for which is ctpa].,"The correct answer is g. ctpa. Prolonged plane journey is a recognized risk factor for thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism. The sharp chest pain and breathlessness 3 days after the plane journey are highly suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the appropriate investigation is ctpa, which is the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. The other options such as bronchoscopy, cardiac enzymes, MRI, pulse oximetry, and V/Q scan do not have enough sensitivity and specificity to accurately diagnose pulmonary embolism. It is important to identify pulmonary embolism early to prevent complications such as pulmonary infarction, heart failure, and even death. Therefore, ctpa is the most appropriate investigation for this clinical scenario.",g,g,TRUE,

[tall thin young men are particularly prone to develop pneumothorax. sudden pain and breathlessness in this young man are highly suggestive of pneumothorax. so investigation of choice is cxr].,"The single most appropriate investigation for a tall thin young man with sudden chest pain and breathlessness is a chest x-ray (CXR). This is because such individuals are particularly prone to develop pneumothorax. The symptoms described are highly suggestive of pneumothorax, which is a condition where air enters the space between the lung and inner chest wall, causing the lung to collapse. CXR is the investigation of choice as it can easily detect the presence of a pneumothorax and guide further management. The other choices, such as cardiac enzymes, ECG, CT, and V/Q scan, are not appropriate in this scenario as they are either not relevant or less likely to be useful in diagnosing pneumothorax.",b,b,TRUE,

Although pheochromocytoma (answer a) may be a close differential for panic disorder, it typically presents with resistant hypertension, headache, and abdominal pain, which are absent in this case. Generalized anxiety disorder (answer c) may present with similar symptoms, but the sudden onset and intensity of the episodes are more suggestive of panic disorder. Phobia (answer d) and acute stress disorder (answer e) may present with fear and anxiety but do not have the same symptom profile as panic disorder. Therefore, based on the symptoms presented, panic disorder is the most probable diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
550. a 55yo woman with a persistent cough and hx of smoking develops left sided chest pain exacerbated by deep breathing with fever and localized crackles. what is the single most appropriate dx?,a. dissecting aneurysm,b. pericarditis,c. pneumonia,d. pneumothorax,e. pulmonary embolism,,,,,,"key: the key is c. pneumonia. [chest pain exacerbated with deep breathing, fever and localized crackles are highly suggestive of pneumonia].","The correct answer is c, pneumonia. This is indicated by the patient's persistent cough and chest pain which is exacerbated by deep breathing, along with the presence of fever and localized crackles. These are all highly suggestive of a respiratory infection such as pneumonia, which is an inflammation of the lung tissue caused by bacterial or viral infection. Dissecting aneurysm, pericarditis, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism are all possible causes of chest pain, but they would not be associated with a persistent cough, fever, and crackles. Thus, they are not the most appropriate diagnoses in this case. In summary, the combination of symptoms presented in this case points towards the correct diagnosis of pneumonia.",c,c,TRUE,

Dysphagia for both solids and liquids, along with a dilated esophagus that tapers to a fine distal end, suggests neuromuscular dysphagia. However, the severe retrosternal chest pain indicates achalasia, which is a neuromuscular disorder that causes the LES to fail to relax properly, leading to symptoms of dysphagia. Lower esophageal sphincter dilation through balloon dilatation is a common and effective treatment modality for achalasia. Therefore, reassurance (a), antispasmodics (b), endoscopic diverticulectomy (d), and repeat barium swallow (e) are not the best management strategies for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because lichen planus typically presents with a lace-like appearance and not thick white marks, while aphthous ulcers have a yellowish floor and are surrounded by an erythematous halo. Although smoking can cause tongue coating, it does not usually result in thick white marks. Leukoplakia is characterized by raised edges and bright white patches that cannot be rubbed out like candida patches, and inflamed tongue points towards an infection. Therefore, candidiasis is the most likely diagnosis, especially considering the patient's history of smoking and inflamed tongue.",d,d,TRUE,

[hippocampal lesion causes mainly memory impairment. cerebellum has its diagnostic features that is not present here. thalamic lesion can lead to impairment of arousal, orientation, learning and memory, facial paresis, language deficit, hemispatial neglect, hemisensory loss, hemiparesis, hemiataxia and visual field defect. brainstem stroke causes impaired consciousness, disorder of blood pressure, and breathing abnormality. given picture is typical of lesion in internal capsule].","The most likely anatomical site affected in this 69-year-old woman with left upper and lower limb paralysis and speaking difficulty is the internal capsule (option c). A hippocampal lesion would primarily result in memory impairment, whereas cerebellar lesions have distinct diagnostic features that are not present here. Lesions in the thalamus can result in a variety of deficits, including impaired arousal, orientation, learning, memory, facial paresis, language deficits, and sensory/motor impairments. Brainstem stroke may cause impaired consciousness, blood pressure disorders, and breathing abnormalities. However, given the patient's symptoms, a lesion in the internal capsule, which is responsible for carrying motor and sensory fibers between the cerebral cortex and spinal cord/brainstem, is the most likely. The characteristic paralysis of the left upper and lower limbs indicates damage to the corticospinal tract, while the difficulty in speaking suggests involvement of the corticobulbar fibers. Therefore, option c is the most appropriate answer.",c,c,TRUE,

Osteoporotic fractures are less common in males with this condition, making choice B incorrect. Paget's disease, multiple myeloma, and spondylosis do not typically present with sudden paraplegia after a trivial fall, making choices A, D, and E incorrect.

The itchy, scaly patch on her scalp is a classic presentation of scalp psoriasis, and her aunt's similar rash on the extensor aspects of her elbows and knees suggests psoriasis as well. Psoriasis is thought to be an immunological disease, and in this case, appears to be genetic. The other choices are not as likely because eczema typically presents with red, inflamed skin and oozing blisters, fungal infections typically involve flaky, itchy skin with a raised red patch, impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that results in yellow or honey-colored crusts, and lichen planus typically involves purple, flat-topped bumps on the skin.",e,e,TRUE,
556. a pt after transurethral prostatic biopsy. what electrolyte imbalance can he develop?,a. hyperkalemia,b. hyponatremia,c. hypocalcemia,d. hypernatremia,e. hypercalcemia,,,,,,key: the key is b. hyponatremia. [use of fluid for bladder irrigation may lead to dilutional hyponatremia].,"After undergoing a transurethral prostatic biopsy, the patient may develop hyponatremia as an electrolyte imbalance due to the use of fluid for bladder irrigation. This is the correct answer to the question, as hyponatremia can occur when too much water is consumed, or when the kidneys are unable to excrete the excess fluids. This can lead to a low concentration of sodium in the blood, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, headache, fatigue, and confusion. The other choices are incorrect since hyperkalemia is an excessive amount of potassium in the blood, hypocalcemia is a lack of calcium, hypernatremia is an excess of sodium, and hypercalcemia is an excess of calcium. Therefore, hyponatremia is the most likely electrolyte imbalance that the patient may develop, and healthcare professionals need to monitor and treat it accordingly.",b,b,TRUE,

This is based on the fact that the patient has established eclampsia, which is a severe complication of preeclampsia characterized by the occurrence of seizures. Magnesium sulfate is the recommended treatment for eclampsia and has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent seizures and maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Option A, diazepam IV, may be used for seizure management; however, magnesium sulfate is preferred as it also has antihypertensive and anticonvulsant properties. Option B, fetal CTG, is not the most appropriate initial management for a patient who is experiencing seizures. Option C, hydralazine IV, is a potent antihypertensive agent and may lower the blood pressure rapidly, which can cause fetal distress. Option D, immediate delivery, may be considered once the patient is stabilized, but it is not the most appropriate initial management.

This is because such symptoms may indicate the presence of HELLP syndrome, a serious complication of pre-eclampsia that affects the liver and blood clotting. A coagulation profile (a) may be relevant if there are signs of abnormal bleeding, but it is not the most appropriate investigation in this case.

This is because the audiogram shows normal bone conduction thresholds, but reduced air conduction thresholds bilaterally, which is characteristic of fluid in the middle ear. The Weber test is also normal, indicating that there is no conductive hearing loss or significant asymmetry between the ears. The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the provided information. Chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane would likely show abnormalities in both bone and air conduction tests and a positive Weber test. Congenital sensorineural deficit and presbyacusis are unlikely given the patient's age. Otosclerosis typically presents with a conductive hearing loss and a positive Rinne test. Therefore, based on the hearing test results, CSOME is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

This disorder, which is characterized by binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting, frequently results in parotid gland hypertrophy. The other choices are not as likely, as C1 esterase deficiency is a rare genetic condition, Crohn’s disease affects the gastrointestinal tract and does not typically cause parotid swelling, mumps usually presents with unilateral parotid swelling, and sarcoidosis involves granulomas in various organs but does not typically cause parotid swelling and hand calluses. Therefore, bulimia nervosa is the single most likely diagnosis for this presentation.",a,a,TRUE,

[in any case of ihd, most important initial management is aspirin].","In this scenario, the correct answer is e. aspirin. The patient is presenting with symptoms that are indicative of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), a condition in which there is inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle. Aspirin is the most important initial management in any case of IHD because it helps to prevent the formation of blood clots that can further restrict blood flow to the heart. The other choices are wrong because beta-blockers and anticoagulant & heparin therapy are not recommended as first-line treatments in this situation. Percutaneous angiography, while often necessary in the management of IHD, is typically not performed as an initial step. Similarly, clopidogrel is not usually prescribed as a first-line treatment for acute coronary syndromes like the one presented here. Thus, the most appropriate next step in this patient's management is to administer aspirin.",e,e,TRUE,

From the options given, the correct answer is option e, which suggests that the only organism that needs to be treated is Gardenella. This is because Gardenella is known to cause a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. 

The other options - a, b, c, and d - are incorrect as they either include organisms that do not cause foul-smelling discharge (such as chlamydia and gonorrhea) or add more organisms to the list than necessary. It is important to note that identifying the right organism is crucial in ensuring effective treatment and prevention of further complications. Therefore, in this case, Gardenella should only be the focus of treatment.",e,e,TRUE,

The presence of obstructive jaundice is indicated by the deep jaundice and pale stools. Galactosemia, G6PD deficiency, Rh incompatibility, and congenital viral infection are not likely to present with obstructive jaundice at this age. Biliary Atresia is a condition in which the bile ducts outside and inside the liver are damaged or absent, leading to bile accumulation and liver damage. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial in improving outcomes for Biliary Atresia. Therefore, it is important to rule out other causes of neonatal jaundice and promptly diagnose and treat this condition.",b,b,TRUE,

[increased thirst and increased frequency in urination along with weight loss is suggestive of dm supported by fasting blood glucose of 9 mmol/l. at the age of 45 most likely type of diabetes is niddm or type 2 dm which is treated by oral hypoglycemic agents].,"The most appropriate management for a 45-year-old man with colon cancer who is presenting with increased thirst, increased frequency of urination, and weight loss, with a fasting blood glucose level of 9mmol/L, would be oral hypoglycemic agents. These symptoms are suggestive of Diabetes Mellitus, which is most likely type 2 or Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), which is treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. Insulin long-acting, short-acting insulin before meal, IV insulin, and subcutaneous insulin are not appropriate for this patient as they are used to treat Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) or type 1 diabetes.

[here already mentioned full thickness burn which is painless. child often cry from anxiety for hypoxaemia and hypovolaemia rather than pain. the patient then responds better to oxygen or increased fluid administration rather than to narcotic analgesics. ref: patient.info].,"The correct key for the management of a 6-year-old child with a full thickness burn who is crying continuously is B, IV fluid stat. Even though the child is crying, it may not necessarily be due to pain as full thickness burns are often painless. In such cases, the child is more likely to be crying from anxiety related to hypoxaemia and hypovolaemia. Therefore, increasing fluid administration or providing oxygen therapy would be more beneficial than administering narcotic analgesics. Hence, the correct action is to start fluid resuscitation with IV fluids stat. Referral to a burn unit may also be necessary depending on the extent of the burn injury, but it is not the first step of management for this case. Antibiotics would not be necessary at this stage, and analgesia may not be indicated if the child is not experiencing pain due to the burn.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient's presentation with intensely itchy rash, scratch marks, and burrows on the wrists and elbows along with red papules on the penis is highly suggestive of scabies. Topical permethrin is an effective treatment for scabies and is the most appropriate management option. Referral to a gum clinic (option b) is not relevant for the treatment of scabies. Topical betnovate (option c) is a steroid cream and is not effective for scabies. Topical ketoconazole (option d) and topical selenium sulphide (option e) are antifungal agents and are not appropriate for the treatment of scabies. Therefore, option a is the correct answer. It is important to note that treatment of scabies should involve all the close contacts of the patient as well to prevent reinfection.",a,a,TRUE,
568. a 4yo has earache and fever. has taken paracetamol several times. now it’s noticed that he increases the tv volume. his preschool hearing test shows symmetric loss of 40db. what is the most likely dx?,a. om with effusion,b. otitis externa,c. cholesteatoma,d. csom,e. tonsillitis,,,,,,key: the key is a. om with effusion.,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is a. Otitis Media with Effusion (OME). OME is a type of ear infection that occurs when the middle ear becomes filled with fluid. It often occurs after a cold or upper respiratory infection, which can cause inflammation and swelling in the Eustachian tube. The fluid buildup can cause pressure and pain, and may affect hearing, as seen in the symmetric loss of 40db on the preschool hearing test. The fact that the patient has taken paracetamol several times and has now increased the TV volume indicates that he is experiencing pain and hearing difficulties. Otitis Externa (b) is an infection of the outer ear canal and would not cause the symmetric hearing loss seen in this case. Cholesteatoma (c) and Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (d) are more serious ear conditions that can also cause hearing loss, but they typically have other symptoms and require more aggressive treatment. Tonsillitis (e) is an unrelated condition that does not typically present with ear-related symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

The gradual onset of symptoms, neck stiffness, photophobia, and fluctuating level of consciousness are all typical signs of meningitis. Furthermore, the CSF analysis reveals lymphocytosis, which is also consistent with TB meningitis. While other conditions such as fungal meningitis (including cryptococcal infection) or CMV infection may present similarly, they are less common and can be excluded based on negative gram stain results. Similarly, candida infection or hairy leukoplakia are not differential diagnoses for meningitis and can also be ruled out.

[this is nai. so the child cannot be handover to the risk again and should be admitted to protect him from further injury done by mothers boyfriend while serial x-rays and relevant investigations done and asked for child protection unit’s help].,"Given the history of the child being looked after by the mother's new boyfriend while she attended college, along with the presence of multiple bruises and a fracture of the left humerus, the single most appropriate next step would be to admit the child under the care of a pediatrician. This is because of the possibility of child abuse and the need for protection for the child. It is crucial to investigate further with serial x-rays and relevant investigations while also seeking the help of the child protection unit to ensure the child's safety. Discharging the child with painkillers or following up in a fracture clinic or pediatric OPD without assessing the possibility of abuse could potentially put the child at risk. Following up with a GP would also not be appropriate in this situation. Therefore, admitting the child under the care of a pediatrician is the most appropriate next step.",a,a,TRUE,
571. a 74yo female presents with headache and neck stiffness to the ed. following a lp the pt was started on iv ceftriaxone. csf culture = listeria monocytogenes. what is the appropriate tx?,a. add iv amoxicillin,b. change to iv amoxicillin + gentamicin,c. add iv ciprofloxacin,d. add iv co-amoxiclav,e. continue iv ceftriaxone as mono-therapy,,,,,,key: the key is b. change to iv amoxicillin + gentamycin. [from the given option b is the most acceptable. however ampicillin + gentamycin is the drug combination of choice].,"In this scenario, the correct answer is b - change to IV amoxicillin + gentamicin. This is the drug combination of choice for treating Listeria monocytogenes, the bacteria that was found using CSF culture. The other options are not appropriate for treating this specific infection - IV ciprofloxacin is typically used for urinary tract infections, IV co-amoxiclav is often used for respiratory tract infections, and continuing IV ceftriaxone as monotherapy is not recommended as it may not effectively treat the Listeria infection. While IV amoxicillin alone could be effective in treating Listeria, the combination with gentamicin is preferred as it enhances the activity of amoxicillin against the bacteria. Therefore, b is the most appropriate choice for the patient's treatment.",b,b,TRUE,
"572. a pt presents with fever, dry cough and breathlessness. he is tachypneic but chest is clear. oxygen saturation is normal at rest but drops on exercise. what is the single most likely dx?",a. cmv infection,b. candida infection,c. pneumocystis carinii infection,d. cryptococcal infection,e. toxoplasma abscess,,,,,,"key: the key is c. pneumocystis carinii infection. [fever, dry cough, breathlessness, tachypnoea with clear chest is seen in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. normal oxygen saturation which drops on exercise is characteristic of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia].","The single most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms is c. pneumocystis carinii infection. This is because fever, dry cough, breathlessness and tachypnea with a clear chest are characteristic of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Additionally, the normal oxygen saturation that drops on exercise is also commonly seen in this type of pneumonia. The other choices are less likely as they do not typically present with these specific symptoms. CMV infection can cause fever and shortness of breath but a clear chest and normal oxygen saturation is not typical. Candida infection is more commonly associated with localized symptoms such as thrush. Cryptococcal infection is associated with meningitis and may present with neurological symptoms. Lastly, toxoplasma abscess primarily affects the brain and may cause headaches, confusion and seizures. Therefore, the single most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms is pneumocystis carinii infection.",c,c,TRUE,
573. a 14yo boy fell and hit his head in the playground school. he didn’t lose consciousness. he has swelling and tenderness of the right cheek with a subconjuctival hemorrhage on his right eye. what is the most appropriate initial inv?,a. ct brain,b. eeg,c. mri,d. skull xr,e. facial xr,,,,,,"key: the key is e. facial x-ray. [there is no sign of basal fracture (panda sign is suggestive of basal fracture, not subconjunctival hemorrhage- unless posterior border of hemorrhage is not visible) and no indication of ct scan (there are some criteria for ct scan which are not fulfilled here)].","The most appropriate initial investigation in the case of a 14-year-old boy who fell and hit his head in the playground school, and has swelling and tenderness of the right cheek with a subconjunctival hemorrhage on his right eye, is a facial x-ray. This is because there is no sign of basal fracture, and no indication of a CT scan as the criteria for CT scan are not fulfilled. EEG and MRI are not appropriate investigations in this case as they are used to investigate brain function and structure respectively, and there is no indication of brain involvement in this case. Skull x-ray is also not appropriate as it does not provide a clear picture of the facial bones that are affected in this case. Therefore, a facial x-ray is the most appropriate initial investigation.",e,e,TRUE,
574. a 15m child is due for his mmr vaccine. there is a fam hx of egg allergy. he is febrile with acute om. what is the single most appropriate action?,a. defer immunization for 2wks,b. don’t give vaccine,c. give half dose of vaccine,d. give paracetamol with future doses of the same vaccine,e. proceed with standard immunization schedule,,,,,,key: the key is a. defer immunization for 2 wks.,"The correct answer is a. Defer immunization for 2 weeks. This is the most appropriate action because the child is currently febrile with acute otitis media, which is a contraindication for receiving any vaccine. Additionally, since there is a family history of egg allergy, it is important to assess the child's allergy status before administering the MMR vaccine, which contains egg-derived components. Deferment for 2 weeks gives enough time for the child to recover from the acute illness and for allergy testing to be performed, if necessary. The other choices are incorrect because administering a vaccine during an acute illness can lead to complications, giving a half-dose vaccine is not recommended and may not provide adequate protection against the disease, giving paracetamol with future doses of the vaccine does not address the current contraindication due to the acute otitis media, and proceeding with the standard immunization schedule without considering the child's current medical condition and family history of allergy can be unsafe.",a,a,TRUE,

[the patient is immunocompromized with signs of infection (temp=40◦c, left sided abdominal pain and lymphadenitis) broad spectrum iv antibiotic should be started empirically while waiting for blood reports].","Based on the patient's immunocompromised state and presenting symptoms, the correct answer is b, to start broad spectrum IV antibiotics empirically while waiting for blood test results. This approach is necessary to address the possibility of a serious infection, such as sepsis, which can quickly become life-threatening. Waiting for blood test results or monitoring pyrexia alone may delay appropriate treatment and exacerbate the patient's condition. Oral antibiotics may also be insufficient in treating a potential systemic infection, especially in immunocompromised patients. The CBC may provide useful information but does not address the critical need to initiate immediate treatment. Therefore, starting broad spectrum IV antibiotics empirically is the most appropriate initial step to manage this patient's condition while awaiting blood test results.",b,b,TRUE,
"576.  a 40yo man with marked weight loss over the preceding 6m has bilateral white, vertically corrugated lesion on the lateral surfaces of the tongue. what is the single most likely dx?",a. c1 esterase deficiency,b. crohns disease,c. hiv disease,d. sarcoidosis,e. sjogren’s syndrome,,,,,,key: the key is c. hiv disease. [the lesion described is leukoplakia which is likely association of hiv disease].,"The correct answer is C, HIV disease. The white, vertically corrugated lesion on the lateral surfaces of the tongue described in the question is known as leukoplakia. Leukoplakia is a common oral manifestation of HIV infection and can be seen in up to 20-30% of HIV-infected individuals. C1 esterase deficiency, Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, and Sjogren's syndrome are all unlikely causes of the oral lesion described in the question. Therefore, the single most likely diagnosis in this case is HIV disease.",c,c,TRUE,
"577. a 3m baby was miserable and cried for 2h following his 1st routine immunization with dtp, hib and meningitis. what is the single most appropriate action?",a. defer immunization for 2wks,b. don’t give vaccine,c. give half dose of vaccine,d. give paracetamol with future doses of the same vaccine,e. proceed with standard immunization schedule,,,,,,key: the key is e. proceed with standard immunization schedule.,"The correct answer is E) proceed with the standard immunization schedule. The baby's reaction to the first immunization is not uncommon and does not warrant a change in the standard schedule. Deferment of immunization could increase the risk of the baby contracting a vaccine-preventable disease. Withholding the vaccine altogether is not recommended as the benefits of immunization far outweigh the risks. Giving a half-dose of the vaccine is not recommended as it may not provide sufficient protection against the diseases. Lastly, giving paracetamol with future doses of the same vaccine is not recommended as it may mask symptoms of an adverse reaction, making it harder to identify and treat. Therefore, proceeding with the standard immunization schedule is the most appropriate action.",e,e,TRUE,
578. a 65yo man with htn develops gingival hyperplasia. what is the single most likely dx?,a. acei,b. beta blockers,c. crohns disease,d. nifedipine,e. sarcoidosis,,,,,,key: the key is d. nifedipine. [gingival hyperplasia is a recognized side effect of calcium channel blockers].,"The correct answer is d. Nifedipine. Gingival hyperplasia is a well-known side effect of calcium channel blockers like nifedipine. ACE inhibitors and beta blockers are unlikely to cause gingival hyperplasia. Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis are systemic conditions that are not typically associated with gingival changes. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this 65-year-old man with HTN and gingival hyperplasia is nifedipine-induced hyperplasia. It is important to consider this side effect when prescribing calcium channel blockers and to monitor patients for gingival changes.",d,d,TRUE,
579. a 65yo woman is undergoing coronary angiography. what measure will protect her kidneys from contrast?,a. furosemide,b. dextrose,c. 0.45% saline,d. 0.9% saline,,,,,,,key: the key is d. 0.9% saline.,"The correct answer to the question is d. 0.9% saline. This solution is commonly used as a preventative measure to protect the kidneys from contrast-induced nephropathy during coronary angiography. It has been found to be more effective than both 0.45% saline and dextrose. Furosemide, on the other hand, is a diuretic which can be used to treat fluid retention, but it is not an appropriate solution for preventing contrast-induced nephropathy. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is d. 0.9% saline.",d,d,TRUE,
580. an 83yo woman who is a resident in a nursing home is admitted to hospital with a 4d hx of diarrhea. she has had no weight loss or change in appetite. she has been on analgesics for 3wks for her back pain. she is in obvious discomfort. on rectal exam: fecal impaction. what is the single most appropriate immediate management?,a. codeine phosphate for pain relief,b. high fiber diet,c. oral laxative,d. phosphate enema,e. urinary catheterization,,,,,,key: the key is d. phosphate enema. [in feacal impaction oral laxative is not the choice but phosphate enema is the best option here].,"In this scenario, the single most appropriate immediate management for an 83-year-old woman with a 4-day history of diarrhea, fecal impaction, and back pain from analgesic use would be D. Phosphate enema. While pain relief with codeine phosphate may help alleviate her discomfort, it does not address the underlying issue of fecal impaction. A high fiber diet may be helpful in preventing fecal impaction in the future, but is not an immediate solution to her current situation. Oral laxatives may also be ineffective in treating fecal impaction, as they may not reach the hardened stool. Urinary catheterization is not necessary in this case, as there is no indication of urinary retention. A phosphate enema is the best option in this scenario, as it may help to soften the stool and provide relief of the fecal impaction.",d,d,TRUE,

[patients on steroid develop suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and frequently may lead to adrenal insufficiency (here vomiting, abdominal pain and sudden falls in the morning secondary to postural hypotension on getting up from bed points towards the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency)].","The most specific cause for the patient's symptoms is adrenal insufficiency. Patients on steroids often experience suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis which can ultimately lead to adrenal insufficiency. The patient's presenting symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, and sudden falls in the morning due to postural hypotension upon waking up from bed indicate that her adrenal glands are not producing enough hormones to maintain normal bodily functions. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E are not specific causes for the patient's symptoms, as they do not account for the suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis that occurs with steroid use.",c,c,TRUE,

[the elderly lady with giant cell arteritis is getting high dose steroid which can lead to demineralization and osteopenia or osteoporosis. so to prevent this bisphosphonates are given].,"In an elderly woman with unilateral headache and pain on chewing, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 70mm/hr and steroid therapy suggests giant cell arteritis. However, high dose steroid therapy can cause demineralization, leading to osteoporosis or osteopenia. Therefore, the appropriate additional treatment would be bisphosphonates, which help prevent bone loss. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), ACE inhibitors (ACEi), interferon (IFN), and IV steroids are not indicated in this patient as they do not address the issue of bone loss.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient is presenting symptoms of probable meningococcal meningitis, and before confirming the diagnosis, the suggested treatment is to use cefotaxime for individuals under 55 years old and cefotaxime plus ampicillin for individuals over 55 years old to also cover listeria. Therefore, cefotaxime is the appropriate choice for this patient. The other options, ampicillin, tetracycline, acyclovir, and dexamethasone, may be used in the treatment of other types of infections, but they are not the best medication for meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria. It is important to note that the diagnosis should be confirmed before initiating treatment, which may alter the management plan. Reference: OHCM 9th edition, page 832.",b,b,TRUE,

[the age supports the diagnosis of all along with the given picture. same picture can happen in aplastic anaemia but there is not a single factor mentioned in favour of it. so all can be taken as best option in the given scenario].,"Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for the 15-year-old girl is ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). The presence of anemia, chest infection, and thrombocytopenia, along with the regression and reappearance of symptoms, are indicative of ALL. Moreover, the possible presence of meningitis could also be linked to the compromised immune system that comes with leukemia. Aplastic anemia, CML, and CLL are unlikely as there is no mention of significant factors associated with these conditions. Although the given symptoms can occur in Aplastic anemia, there are no specific features mentioned in favor of it. Therefore, the answer ""b. all"" is the most appropriate option.",b,b,TRUE,
585. a pt was admitted to the ed after a head injury. when examined on arrival his gcs=15 and then at night his gcs deteriorated to 12. what investigation should be done?,a. ct head,b. xr skull,c. iv mannitol,d. drill a burr hole,e. shift to or,,,,,,key: the key is a. ct head. [initial gcs 15 followed by later gcs 12 are suggestive of intracranial haemorrhage. so the best investigation to be done is ct head].,"The correct answer is a) CT head. The patient's admission to the ED following a head injury with a GCS of 15 indicates that there may have been a head injury during the trauma. However, the subsequent deterioration of GCS to 12 suggests the possibility of an intracranial hemorrhage. A CT head is the best investigation to confirm this diagnosis as it provides a detailed image of the brain, allowing for a close examination of any potential bleeds or other abnormalities. X-ray of the skull is not indicated here as it would not provide sufficient information about the brain tissue. IV mannitol and drill a burr hole are not relevant options here as they are treatments for specific types of intracranial hemorrhages. Therefore, the correct approach for this patient is to perform a CT head.",a,a,TRUE,

OME is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear without any signs of acute infection. The boy's symptoms such as the mild earache, bilateral dull tympanic membranes, and symmetrical loss of 40dB on his hearing test are indicative of OME. The other options such as acute otitis externa, ear wax, and foreign body are less likely due to the absence of specific symptoms, while acute otitis media is less likely as the boy does not present with acute infection symptoms. Therefore, OME is the most likely diagnosis for this case.",e,e,TRUE,
587. an 18yo man presents to his gp with thirst and polyuria. some 6m ago he had a significant head injury as the result of a rta. he is referred to the local endocrine clinic. which of the following results would be the most useful in confirming the dx of diabetes insipidus after a water deprivation test (without additional desmopressin)?,a. plasma sodium of 126mmol/l,b. plasma sodium of 150mmol/l,c. plasma osmolality of 335mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 700mosmol/kg,d. plasma osmolality of 280mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 700mosmol/kg,e. plasma osmolality of 335mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 200mosmol/kg,,,,,,key: the key is e. plasma osmolality of 335 mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 200 mosmol/kg.

Plasma osmolality of 335mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 200mosmol/kg. This is because in diabetes insipidus, the body is unable to regulate water balance, resulting in excessive thirst and urine output. A water deprivation test is used to confirm the diagnosis, which involves withholding fluids and monitoring changes in plasma and urine osmolality. In this case, a high plasma osmolality of 335mosmol/kg and a low urine osmolality of 200mosmol/kg indicate that the body is unable to concentrate urine properly, supporting a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. The other choices are not relevant to the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. A low plasma sodium (choice a) may indicate hyponatremia, but not necessarily diabetes insipidus. A high plasma sodium (choice b) may indicate dehydration, but not necessarily diabetes insipidus. A plasma osmolality of 335mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 700mosmol/kg (choice c and d) suggest normal water balance, which would not confirm a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.",e,e,TRUE,

The presence of ear pain and discomfort during swallowing, accompanied by ulceration at the back of the tongue and palpable non-tender cervical lymph node are all suggestive of this condition. Acute mastoiditis and tonsillitis are unlikely to cause tongue ulcers, while dental abscess does not typically present with cervical mass. Herpes zoster infection would be associated with pain and vesicles in the affected nerve distribution, whereas the symptoms presented in this case are not consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is d. oropharyngeal malignancy.",d,d,TRUE,

[day time somnolence and obesity (high bmi of 36) points the diagnosis of osas].,"The correct answer is d. OSAS, or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This is the most likely diagnosis for a 42-year-old man who is experiencing excessive daytime somnolence and has a high BMI of 36. OSAS is characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to brief arousals from sleep and daytime sleepiness. The other answer choices are not likely based on the given information. Idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy are characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness without upper airway obstruction. Chest hyperventilation syndrome is a respiratory disorder that causes dyspnea and hyperventilation, but does not typically cause sleepiness. REM-related sleep disorder is characterized by acting out dreams during sleep, but not necessarily daytime sleepiness. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is OSAS.",d,d,TRUE,

[this is a case of carpal tunnel syndrome. so transverse carpal ligament is the structure which will be incised].,"The correct answer to this question is b, the transverse carpal ligament. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that results from the compression of the median nerve as it passes through the wrist, and the transverse carpal ligament is responsible for forming the roof of the carpal tunnel. This structure is typically incised during carpal tunnel release surgery in order to relieve pressure on the median nerve. Choices a, c, and d are not involved in the pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome and would not be incised during this procedure. It is important to note that carpal tunnel release surgery is a common and effective treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome, and patients often experience significant improvement in their symptoms following this procedure.",b,b,TRUE,

The presenting symptoms and examination findings are typical of this condition, which involves the development of cancerous growths in the colon or rectum. Celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome are all potential differential diagnoses, but they would be less likely based on the current data. Celiac disease typically presents with malabsorption symptoms and is not associated with ulcers. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may cause ulcers or inflammation, but they are typically associated with other symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause ulcers or bleeding. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option A, colorectal carcinoma.",a,a,TRUE,
592. a mother is concerned that her 18m son has a vocabulary of ten words but can’t form a sentence. what is the best management strategy?,a. arrange hearing test,b. assess developmental milestones,c. reassurance,d. refer to speech therapist,e. mri brain,,,,,,key: the key is c. reassurance. [two words joining can be done in 2yrs and inability to form a sentence in 18 months is quite normal. so the option is reassurance].,"The correct answer for the best management strategy for a mother’s concern about her 18-month-old son’s vocabulary of ten words and inability to form a sentence is c. reassurance. This is because it is normal for a child at this age to not yet be able to form a sentence and the ability to join two words is expected to develop within the next two years. Therefore, the mother should be reassured that her son's language development is normal and will continue to progress. On the other hand, arranging a hearing test or referring to a speech therapist would not be necessary at this point because the issue is not a hearing impairment or a speech disorder. Assessing developmental milestones can be helpful, but in this case, it is not necessary since inability to form sentences at 18 months is already expected. Lastly, an MRI Brain would not be helpful in managing this issue.",c,c,TRUE,

[hypercalcemia is common in squamous cell carcinoma].,"The correct answer is a. Hypercalcemia is commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma. This is due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by the tumor cells, leading to increased bone resorption and release of calcium into the bloodstream. Weight loss, dyspnea, and syncope are all common symptoms associated with lung cancer. Smoking is a significant risk factor for developing squamous cell carcinoma. Hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, and hypomagnesium are not typically associated with this cancer, while hypocalcemia is not a common finding in squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, the single most likely biochemical abnormality associated with this condition is hypercalcemia.",a,a,TRUE,
594. a 72yo man presents with intermittent difficulty in swallowing with regurgitation of stale food materials. sometimes he wakes up at night with a feeling of suffocation. choose the single most likely cause of dysphagia?,a. benign structure,b. esophageal carcinoma,c. esophageal spasm,d. pharyngeal pouch,e. systemic sclerosis,,,,,,"key: the key is d. pharyngeal pouch. [in benign stricture, esophageal carcinoma and systemic sclerosis there is persistent dysphagia not intermittent. in oesophageal spasm there may be intermittent dysphagea but there will be no regurgitation of stale food material and no nocturnal regurgitation in recumbency. the clinical picture described well fits with pharyngeal pouch].","The most likely cause of the patient's dysphagia is a pharyngeal pouch. This is supported by the presenting symptoms of intermittent difficulty swallowing with regurgitation of stale food materials, and nocturnal episodes of feeling suffocated. Other potential causes such as benign stricture and esophageal carcinoma typically result in persistent dysphagia rather than intermittent, while esophageal spasm may lead to intermittent dysphagia but without regurgitation or nocturnal symptoms. Systemic sclerosis may also present with dysphagia, but typically involves the lower esophagus rather than the pharynx where the pouch is located. Thus, the clinical picture described is consistent with a pharyngeal pouch as the most likely cause of the patient's dysphagia.",d,d,TRUE,

Elective herniotomy is indicated for irreducible hernias without features of strangulation. Emergency herniotomy would only be recommended if there were features of strangulation. Reassurance is not appropriate as an irreducible hernia requires surgical intervention.

Crohn's disease. The individual's symptoms are consistent with Crohn's disease, including diarrhea, bleeding, weight loss, and the presence of a fistula. Celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and IBS may share some similar symptoms, but are not usually associated with fistulas, which are a hallmark of Crohn's disease. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Crohn's disease.",b,b,TRUE,

[loop diuretic causes hypokalemia and hyponatremia].","The correct answer is A, with an electrolyte imbalance of low potassium (hypokalemia) and low sodium (hyponatremia). This is a common adverse effect of using loop diuretics, which work by blocking sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle in the kidneys. This leads to increased sodium and water excretion, but can also cause depletion of potassium and sodium levels in the body. The other answer choices are incorrect as they do not reflect the electrolyte imbalances typically associated with loop diuretic use. Choice B has high potassium levels, which is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and diuretic use. Choices C and D have normal sodium and potassium levels, which do not explain the patient’s symptoms. Choice E suggests that no electrolyte imbalance was found, which is unlikely given the patient’s symptoms and the known effects of loop diuretics on electrolyte balance.",a,a,TRUE,
599. a 60yo diabetic pt on anti-diabetic medication developed diarrhea. what is the most likely cause for his diarrhea?,a. autonomic neuropathy,b. infective,c. celiac disease,d. crohns disease,,,,,,,key: the key is a. autonomic neuropathy.,"The correct answer for the cause of diarrhea in a 60-year-old diabetic patient on anti-diabetic medication is a. autonomic neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy is a condition that occurs when there is nerve damage to the organs or glands that regulate the functions of the body such as digestion, bladder control, blood pressure, and heart rate. In this case, the damage to the autonomic nerves that control bowel movements could result in diarrhea. Additionally, it is important to note that the other options such as infective, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease are less likely in this scenario as they would typically present with additional symptoms and require further investigation to be ruled out.",a,a,TRUE,
600. which artery runs in the anterior inter-ventricular groove?,a. acute marginal branch,b. left ant descending artery,c. septal branches,d. circumflex artery,e. right coronary artery,,,,,,key: b. left anterior descending artery.,"The correct answer for the artery that runs in the anterior inter-ventricular groove is b. left anterior descending artery. The left anterior descending artery, or LAD, is a major branch of the left coronary artery and runs down the front of the heart, within the anterior inter-ventricular groove. This artery supplies blood to a large portion of the left ventricle, making it a crucial artery for the heart's function. The other choices presented as answers, including the acute marginal branch, septal branches, circumflex artery, and right coronary artery, do not run within the anterior inter-ventricular groove and are not associated with its crucial function in the heart's functioning.",b,b,TRUE,

This would involve evaluating if the child has reached the relevant milestones, such as saying one word clearly at 12 months, sitting independently at 8 months, and playing with toys since early infancy. This can help determine if the child is experiencing a delay in development and, if so, what interventions or therapies may be needed. Arranging a hearing test, referring the child to a speech therapist, or getting an MRI brain scan may also be indicated based on the results of the developmental assessment, but reassurance alone would not be sufficient in the face of such concerning symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,

[large multiple cotton wool spots are seen in early stage of cmv retinitis].,"The single most likely diagnosis for this patient's progressive visual deterioration and the presence of large, multiple cotton wool spots in both eyes is c. CMV infection. CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The other options listed, including Kaposi's sarcoma, cryptosporidium, Pneumocystis carinii infection, and cryptococcal infection, are less likely to present with this distinctive finding of large, multiple cotton wool spots in both eyes. While other symptoms and exam findings may be present in these conditions, they would not be the single most likely diagnosis based on the provided information.",c,c,TRUE,

[infective endocarditis].,"The correct answer is d. infection, specifically infective endocarditis. This is because the patient had recent dental work, which can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream and potentially infect the heart valve. The high temperature, new cardiac murmur, and cardiac failure are all consistent with infective endocarditis. Atheroma (a buildup of plaque in blood vessels), congenital heart disease, regeneration (not a medical term in this context), and neoplastic (cancerous) growths do not explain all of the patient's symptoms and are therefore not the most likely diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because approximately 50% of interosseous nerve lesions occur in supracondylar fractures, which are located around the elbow. Additionally, 25% of such fractures show radial nerve damage, which matches the boy's symptoms. On the other hand, spiral fracture of the lower third of humerus causes nerve damage in 18% of cases, most of which are radial nerve lesions. This means that the option d. spiral fracture is wrong. The other choices b. epiphyseal fracture and c. compound fracture cannot be ruled out solely based on the given information. Therefore, the most appropriate option that fits the symptoms and site of the injury is a. angulated (supracondylar fracture).",d,d,TRUE,

[third person hallucinations are auditory hallucinations in which patients hear voices talking about themselves, referring to them in the third person, for example ""he is an evil person""].","The correct answer is b. This woman is experiencing 3rd person auditory hallucinations, as she hears voices specifically referring to her in the third person as ""he"" or ""she"" instead of using her name or addressing her directly. This is a common symptom of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. 2nd person auditory hallucinations would be hearing voices talking directly to the person, using ""you"" statements instead of ""he"" or ""she."" Echo de la pensee and gedankenlautwerden are both related to schizophrenia but refer to the experience of hearing one's own thoughts aloud or having one's thoughts broadcasted to others, rather than hearing external voices.",b,b,TRUE,

[ca 125 = ovarian cancer; ca 153 = cancer breast; ca 199 = pancreatic cancer; cea = colorectal carcinoma; afp = hepatocellular carcinoma].,"The correct answer is d. CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) is a marker commonly used to monitor colorectal cancer recurrence. In this case, the patient had an excision of a colonic tumor three years ago and is now presenting with symptoms that could indicate a recurrence. Ca 125 is typically used for ovarian cancer, Ca 153 for breast cancer, Ca 199 for pancreatic cancer, and AFP for hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, options a, b, c, and e are all inappropriate for the patient's symptoms and medical history. For this reason, the most appropriate investigation to order is CEA to monitor the possibility of colorectal cancer recurrence.",d,d,TRUE,

The patient is African-Caribbean and 46 years old, which falls under the ""if age less than 55 years but Afro-Caribbean origin then CCB"" category in the key. It is important to note that while ACEI (a type of blood pressure medication) is a commonly prescribed medication, it is not the best initial treatment for this patient. Beta-blockers and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) are also not the best initial treatment for this patient. Choosing none of these options is also not appropriate, as high blood pressure should be treated to prevent further complications. Therefore, the best initial treatment for this patient is a CCB.",e,e,TRUE,

This means that out of 200 women who undergo tubal sterilization, 1 of them will still become pregnant. Choice a, 1:50, implies a much higher failure rate, while choices c, d, and e imply a lower failure rate. It is important to note that while tubal sterilization is highly effective, it is not 100% effective and there is still a small risk of failure. It is important for the patient to discuss all options and risks with their healthcare provider to make an informed decision.",b,b,TRUE,

[anal reflex – s2-4; ankle jerk – s1-2; biceps jerk – c5-6; knee jerk – l3-4; triceps jerk – c7].,"The correct answer is D. Knee jerk - L3 & L4. The knee jerk reflex is elicited by tapping the patellar tendon, which stretches the quadriceps muscle group, and causes a reflex contraction of the muscle resulting in a visible jerk. The knee jerk reflex is mediated by the L3 and L4 spinal nerves, which innervate the quadriceps muscle group. Option A is incorrect as the anal reflex is mediated by the S2-4 spinal nerves, which innervate the pelvic floor muscles. Option B is incorrect as the ankle jerk reflex is mediated by the S1-2 spinal nerves, which innervate the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in the lower leg. Option C is incorrect as the biceps jerk reflex is mediated by the C5-6 spinal nerves, which innervate the biceps muscle in the upper arm. Option E is incorrect as the triceps jerk reflex is mediated by the C7 spinal nerve, which innervates the triceps muscle in the upper arm. Therefore, option D is the accurate pairing of the knee jerk reflex with the correct innervating spinal nerves.",d,d,TRUE,
"610. a 62yo man with rheumatoid arthritis struck his hand against a door. he subsequently found that although he could extend the interphalangeal joint of his right thumb, the mcp joint of the thumb remained flex. what is the single most likely tendon to have been damaged?",a. extensor carpi ulnaris,b. extensor digitorum,c. extensor indicis,d. extensor pollicis brevis,e. extensor pollicis longus,,,,,,key: the key is d. extensor pollicis brevis. [action of extensor pollicis brevis = extension of thumb at metacarpophalangeal joint. extensor pollicis longus = extends the terminal phalanx of the thumb].,"Based on the symptoms described, the most likely tendon to have been damaged in the 62yo man with rheumatoid arthritis who struck his hand against a door is the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendon. The EPB is responsible for extending the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, and if it is damaged, the MCP joint would remain flexed while the interphalangeal joint could still extend. The other choices, including the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum, extensor indicis, and extensor pollicis longus, do not have a direct role in controlling the MCP joint of the thumb. Therefore, the most likely answer is d, extensor pollicis brevis.",d,d,TRUE,

[drop attacks are sudden spontaneous falls while standing or walking, with complete recovery in seconds or minutes. there is usually no recognized loss of consciousness, and the event is remembered].","Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is d. drop attacks. This is characterized by sudden falls while standing or walking with complete recovery in seconds or minutes, and no loss of consciousness or confusion. Stokes Adams attacks (a) involve sudden loss of consciousness and hypoglycemia (b) presents with confusion, sweating, and tremors. Vasovagal syncope (c) also involves loss of consciousness. Epilepsy (e) is characterized by seizures which do not match the presented symptoms of the patient. Therefore, based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is d. drop attacks.",d,d,TRUE,
612. a 50yo man complains of being pursued by the police for a crime he denies committing. he has poor concentration and impaired short-term memory. he admits to drinking large amounts of alcohol for the last 20yrs. what is the most probable dx?,a. dementia,b. hallucination,c. wernicke’s encephalopathy,d. schizophrenia,e. korsakoff psychosis,,,,,,"key: the key is e. korsakoff psychosis. [dementia, i.e. short term memory loss is seen in korsakoff psychosis].","The most probable diagnosis for the 50-year-old man with poor concentration, impaired short-term memory, and belief of being pursued by the police, who admits to heavy alcohol consumption for the past 20 years, is Korsakoff psychosis. Korsakoff psychosis is a neurological disorder that is caused by a deficiency in thiamine, a vitamin that is important for brain function. It is often seen in individuals with chronic alcoholism due to their poor nutritional status. The symptoms of Korsakoff psychosis include confusion, memory loss, and confabulation, which is the creation of false memories to fill gaps in memory. Dementia may also cause memory loss, but Korsakoff psychosis is more specific to chronic alcoholism. Hallucination may occur in various psychiatric disorders, but this individual does not show evidence of experiencing hallucinations. Wernicke’s encephalopathy is an acute neurological condition that can occur in alcoholics, but it is characterized by confusion, ocular abnormalities, and ataxia. Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that is characterized by positive and negative symptoms, but this individual does not demonstrate features of schizophrenia. Therefore, Korsakoff psychosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case, based on the symptoms and alcohol consumption history of the patient.",e,e,TRUE,
"613.  a pt with prv hx of htn, the membranes have ruptured and the cervix is 3cm dilated. 4h later on examination showed that the cervix was still 3cm dilated. what is the single most appropriate management for her labor?",a. repeat vaginal examination in 4h,b. ctg,c. c-section,d. external rotation,e. iv syntocin drip,,,,,,key: the key is e. iv syntocinon drip. [there is no progress of labour in 4 hours. hence syntocinon drip should be given].,"In a patient with a previous history of hypertension and ruptured membranes with no progress in cervical dilation after 4 hours, the single most appropriate management for labor is the administration of IV Syntocinon drip. This medication helps induce and strengthen contractions to help progress labor. Repeat vaginal examination in 4 hours would only delay the timely management of labor. CTG would help monitor fetal heart rate, but it is not the appropriate management for a lack of cervical dilation progress. C-section would only be considered as a last resort if other management options are not working. External rotation is not a management option for lack of cervical dilation progress. Thus, based on the given information, IV Syntocinon drip is the most appropriate management option to progress labor.",e,e,TRUE,

[spirometry is the preferred initial test (if available) to assess the presence and severity of airflow obstruction less effort dependent and more repeatable though less applicable in acute severe asthma].,"The correct answer to this question is d. spirometry. Spirometry is the preferred initial test to assess the presence and severity of airflow obstruction. It is less effort dependent and more repeatable, though less applicable in acute severe asthma. In this case, the 6-year-old girl has had 2 short episodes of cough and wheeze over the last 12 months, responded quickly to bronchodilator, and has no symptoms or abnormal physical signs. This suggests mild asthma, which can be diagnosed and monitored with spirometry. A CXR is not necessary in this case because there are no abnormal physical signs, and peak flow rate diary is not the single most appropriate inv because it only measures airflow and not lung volume. Pulse oximetry measures oxygen saturation and is not useful for diagnosing asthma. Sweat test is not necessary because there are no symptoms suggestive of cystic fibrosis. Therefore, the most appropriate test is spirometry, which will assess lung function and aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma.",d,d,TRUE,
615. a 45yo man had recently started taking anti-htn therapy. 6m later his rbs=14mmol/l. which single drug is most likely to have caused this?,a. amlodipine,b. bendroflumethiazide,c. doxazosin,d. lorsartan,e. ramipril,,,,,,key: the key is b. bendroflumethiazide. [high blood sugar is a well known side effect of bendroflumethiazide].,"The correct answer is b. Bendroflumethiazide. High blood sugar is a well-known side effect of bendroflumethiazide. Amlodipine, doxazosin, losartan, and ramipril are all medications used to treat hypertension, but they do not typically cause high blood sugar as a side effect. Therefore, the single drug most likely to have caused the increase in the patient's blood sugar level is bendroflumethiazide.",b,b,TRUE,

The symptoms of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, generalized pelvic tenderness without peritonism, and menorrhagia are all consistent with pelvic congestion syndrome. Endometriosis and uterine fibroids can cause similar symptoms, but the normal pelvic ultrasound makes these less likely. PID and tubal pregnancy would also present with different symptoms and physical exam findings. Therefore, the correct answer is c, pelvic congestion syndrome.",c,c,TRUE,
"617. a 14yo girl is clinically obese. she has not started her periods yet and has severe acne. among her inv, a high insulin level is found. what is the most probable dx?",a. cushing’s syndrome,b. grave’s disease,c. acquired hypothyroidism,d. pcos,e. addison’s disease,,,,,,"key: the key is d. pcos. [it is not cushing’s as insulin levels in cushing’s are not usually raised! here obesity, primary amenorrhea , acne and particularly high level of insulin makes the likely diagnosis to pcos].","The most probable diagnosis for this 14-year-old girl is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as indicated by her clinical presentation of obesity, primary amenorrhea, severe acne and a high level of insulin. Cushing's syndrome is not likely as insulin levels are not usually elevated in this condition. Grave's disease and acquired hypothyroidism involve the thyroid gland and do not typically present with insulin abnormalities. Addison's disease is a disorder of the adrenal glands and is not associated with insulin levels or PCOS symptoms. Therefore, PCOS is the most likely diagnosis based on the presented symptoms and laboratory findings.",d,d,TRUE,
618. an 18yo girl with primary amenorrhea complains of severe abdominal pain every 4-8weeks which is now getting worse. exam: lower abdominal mass is felt. what is the most probable dx?,a. ectopic pregnancy,b. ovarian carcinoma,c. hematometrium,d. biliary colic,e. renal carcinoma,,,,,,key: the key is c. hematometrium. [primary amenorrhea and periodic pain indicate hematometrium either secondary to imperforated hymen or vaginal septum].,"The most probable diagnosis for this 18-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea and periodic pain with a lower abdominal mass is c. hematometrium. This is because hematometrium is most commonly caused by either an imperforated hymen or a vaginal septum which leads to the accumulation of menstrual blood in the uterus resulting in severe pain. The other choices are unlikely since an ectopic pregnancy would not present with primary amenorrhea, ovarian carcinoma is unlikely at such a young age and would not cause primary amenorrhea, biliary colic would not present with a lower abdominal mass, and renal carcinoma would have different presenting symptoms. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for this patient's symptoms is hematometrium, which can be confirmed through imaging and further evaluation.",c,c,TRUE,
619. a 14yo boy with asthma suddenly developed chest pain and increasing breathlessness during a game of football. when seen in the ed he was not cyanosed. he has reduced breath sounds on the right side. his oxygen saturation is 94% on air. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. capillary blood gases,b. cxr,c. ct chest,d. exercise challenge,e. mri chest,,,,,,key: the key is b. cxr. [asthma is a predisposing factor for spontaneous pneumothorax. the presentation indicates pneumothorax for which most appropriate investigation is cxr].,"B. CXR is the single most appropriate investigation for a 14-year-old boy with asthma who suddenly develops chest pain and increasing breathlessness during a game of football. The presentation indicates a likely pneumothorax, which may occur spontaneously in people with asthma. The reduced breath sounds on the right side and 94% oxygen saturation on room air support this diagnosis. CXR is the most appropriate investigation because it can confirm the presence of pneumothorax and aid in determining the extent of lung collapse. Capillary blood gases and exercise challenge tests are not appropriate in this situation and are not indicated for the diagnosis of pneumothorax. CT chest and MRI chest are more expensive, time-consuming investigations, and are not necessary for initial diagnosis, which can be made using a CXR. Therefore, B. CXR is the most appropriate investigation for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

Thought broadcasting is a positive symptom of schizophrenia in which a person believes that their thoughts are being transmitted to others without their knowledge or consent. This delusion can be distressing and overwhelming for the individual, leading to anxiety and social isolation. Thought insertion, withdrawal and block are other types of delusions that are not related to the transmission of thoughts to others. Hallucinations refer to perceptual experiences that are not based in reality. Therefore, the most likely symptom that this patient is experiencing is thought broadcasting, which is a form of delusion that is commonly found in individuals with schizophrenia.",d,d,TRUE,
"621. a 60yo woman is admitted to the hospital after a fall. she is noted to have poor eye contact. when asked how she is feeling, she admits to feeling low in mood and losing enjoyment in all her usual hobbies. she has also found it difficult to concentrate, feels that she is not good at anything, feels guilty over minor issues and feels very negative about the future. what is the most likely dx?",a. mild depression,b. moderate depression,c. severe depression,d. psychosis,e. seasonal depression,,,,,,key: the key is a. mild depression. [mild depression: i)low mood ii) anhedonia iii) guilt iv) hopelessness v) worthlessness vi) inability to concentrate].,"Based on the symptoms presented, the most likely diagnosis is mild depression. The patient is experiencing low mood, anhedonia, guilt, hopelessness, worthlessness, and an inability to concentrate. These symptoms are indicative of depression, and the severity appears to be mild based on the fact that the patient has not lost all interest in activities and experiences only minor feelings of guilt. The other answer choices, such as moderate or severe depression, could be possible, but the symptoms presented do not suggest a severe case. Psychosis and seasonal depression are not likely diagnoses based on the information given, as there are no symptoms of hallucinations, delusions, or seasonal patterns. It is important to note that a formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified healthcare professional and not solely based on self-reported symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,
622. a 70yo woman lives in a nursing home following a stroke has developed reddish scaly rash on her trunk. she has many scratch marks on her limbs and trunk with scaling lesions on her hands and feet. what is the single most appropriate initial tx?,a. aqueous cream,b. chlorphenaramine,c. coal tar,d. 1% hydrocortisone ointment,e. permethrin,,,,,,key: the key is e. permethrine. [this is a case of scabies and scaly rash denotes the infection of most severe type the crusted or norwegian scabies. should be treated with permethrine].,"The correct answer to the question is e. permethrin. The patient's presentation is consistent with crusted or Norwegian scabies, which is a severe form of scabies that requires aggressive treatment. Permethrin is a topical medication that is effective in killing the mite and is considered the most appropriate initial treatment in this case. Aqueous cream, chlorphenaramine, coal tar, and 1% hydrocortisone ointment are not appropriate initial treatments for crusted scabies. Aqueous cream is a moisturizer that does not treat the underlying infection. Chlorphenaramine is an antihistamine that can provide symptomatic relief but does not treat the underlying infection. Coal tar is used to treat psoriasis and other skin conditions, but it is not effective against scabies. 1% hydrocortisone ointment can provide temporary relief of itching and inflammation but does not treat the scabies infection. Therefore, permethrin is the most appropriate initial treatment for crusted scabies.",e,e,TRUE,
623. a 16yo boy following a rta was brought to the ed with a swelling and deformity in his right thigh. exam: airway is patent and is found to have a pulseless leg. which structure is involved in this fx?,a. femoral artery,b. posterior tibial artery,c. common peroneal nerve,d. dorsalis pedis,,,,,,,key: the key is a. femoral artery.,"Based on the information provided, the correct answer to this question is A. Femoral artery. The 16-year-old boy likely suffered a traumatic injury in the right thigh that caused swelling and deformity, resulting in obstruction/blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the leg. The pulseless leg can be attributed to the lack of blood flow caused by the damaged femoral artery. The other options (B, C, and D) are unlikely to cause a pulseless leg in this scenario as they don't supply blood to the entire leg, and therefore, cannot cause the level of damage observed in the patient's leg. In conclusion, the boy's pulseless leg suggests a disruption of the femoral artery, making option A the correct answer.",a,a,TRUE,
624. a man sat cross-legged for about 30mins. after this he was unable to dorsiflex his left foot and had loss of sensation in the web space between the big toe and the 2nd toe. he also has sensory loss on the same side of the foot after 2h. which of the following was affected?,a. femoral nerve,b. sural nerve,c. peroneal nerve,d. sciatic nerve,,,,,,,key: the key is c. peroneal nerve. [common peroneal nerve winds round the fibular neck at knee joint and when a man sits cross legged for a considerable time pressure exerted on the nerve may cause nerve palsi].,"The correct answer to this question is c. peroneal nerve. When a person sits cross-legged for a long time, it can cause pressure on the common peroneal nerve which winds around the fibular neck at the knee joint. This can result in nerve palsy, which may lead to the symptoms described in the question. The femoral nerve controls hip flexion and knee extension and is not related to the symptoms described. The sural nerve provides sensation to the lateral foot and is not connected to the symptoms described. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and it innervates the muscles in the back of the thigh, lower leg, and foot. However, it is not usually affected by the posture of sitting cross-legged. Therefore, the peroneal nerve is the most likely nerve affected in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,

[diarrhea, abdominal bloating, blistering skin rash over elbow (dermatitis herpetiformis), low serum albumin, calcium and folate conc. supported by shortening of villi and lymphocytosis on jejuna biopsy is classic presentation of celiac disease].","The most likely diagnosis for this 25-year-old woman presenting with diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and blistering rash over her elbows, along with low serum albumin, calcium and folate concentrations, and shortening of the villi and lymphocytosis on jejunal biopsy, is celiac disease. Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by consuming gluten-containing foods and affects the small intestine's lining, leading to malabsorption. This diagnosis is supported by the classic presentation of celiac disease with gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash, and nutrient deficiencies. The other options are less likely since they do not present with the characteristic features of celiac disease, such as gluten intolerance or malabsorption. Therefore, option A is the most accurate diagnosis based on the presented clinical features and laboratory findings.",a,a,TRUE,

[delusions of persecution refer to false beliefs or perceptions in which a person believes that they are being treated with malicious intent, hostility, or harassment – despite significant evidence to suggest otherwise].","The correct answer for this question is a. Delusion of persecution. This is because the man has a false belief that he is being followed by terrorists who are plotting against him despite there being no significant evidence to support his claim. This type of delusion is characterized by a person's belief that they are being treated with malicious intent or are being harassed despite no concrete proof. Delusion of grandeur refers to the false belief of having exceptional powers or abilities, delusion of control refers to the belief that one's thoughts or actions are being controlled by an external force, delusion of reference refers to the belief that certain events or cues are specifically related to oneself, and delusion of nihilism refers to the belief that everything is meaningless. Therefore, a is the most appropriate option for this question.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient has a critically low BMI and a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. At this point, medical admission is necessary to help improve her nutritional deficiencies and prevent further complications that may occur with rapid weight loss and evidence of system failure. Urgent referral to an Eating Disorder Unit, Medical Unit, or Pediatric Medical Wards is necessary. It is not appropriate to refer the patient for psychiatric admission (choice a) without first addressing the medical concerns. Family counseling (choice b) and social services (choice c) may be beneficial in some cases, but in this situation, immediate medical intervention is required. Starting antidepressants (choice d) may also be inappropriate without first addressing the patient's nutritional deficiencies and weight loss. Therefore, the appropriate next step is medical admission, given the critical nature of the patient's condition.",e,e,TRUE,

[the probable diagnosis is scabies in which there is itching due to allergic reaction to mites (sarcoptes scabii) waste products].,"The probable diagnosis based on the given information is scabies, a skin infestation caused by mites (sarcoptes scabiei). The itching is a result of an allergic reaction to the mites' waste products. The linear tracks on the wrist are a typical symptom of scabies, as the mites burrow into the skin to lay their eggs. Therefore, the correct answer is c, allergic reaction. Choices a, b, d, and e are incorrect because they do not correspond to the mechanism of itching in scabies. Infection, destruction of keratinocytes, and immunosuppression are not related to scabies, while option e is too vague and does not provide any information about the cause of itching.",c,c,TRUE,
"629. a teacher had a respiratory infection for which she was prescribed antibiotics. after the antibiotic course when she rejoined school, she lost her voice completely. what is the single most appropriate dx?",a. recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy,b. angioedema,c. laryngeal obstruction by medication,d. laryngitis,e. functional dysphonia/vocal cords,,,,,,"key: the key is e. functional dysphonia/vocal cords. [functional dysphonia is poor voice quality without any obvious anatomical, neurological or other organic difficulties affecting the larynx or voice box. it is often secondary to viral infection].","The most appropriate diagnosis for the teacher in this scenario is functional dysphonia/vocal cords, indicated by the key provided ('e'). Functional dysphonia is a condition characterized by poor voice quality without any obvious anatomical, neurological, or other organic difficulties affecting the larynx or voice box. This condition may often be secondary to viral infections, such as the respiratory infection the teacher had. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (choice a), angioedema (choice b), and laryngeal obstruction by medication (choice c) are less likely causes for the teacher's voice loss, since these conditions involve specific anatomical or medical factors which are not apparent in this scenario. Laryngitis (choice d) is a possible alternative diagnosis, but the lack of inflammation or irritation of the larynx suggests a functional rather than organic cause for the teacher's symptoms. Therefore, functional dysphonia is the most appropriate diagnosis for this case.",e,e,TRUE,

Atrial myxoma is a benign primary cardiac tumor that commonly occurs in the left atrium and can present with systemic symptoms such as fever and arthropathy, dyspnea, syncope, and abnormal heart sounds including an early diastolic sound and a mid-diastolic rumble. On the other hand, mitral regurgitation, ventricular ectopics, pulmonary regurgitation, and complete heart block do not typically present with this constellation of symptoms and signs. Therefore, the correct answer is d, atrial myxoma.",d,d,TRUE,
631. a 28yo man presents with a maculopapular rash over his trunk and palms. he also has numerous mouth ulcers. he had a penile ulcer which healed 2wks ago. what will you do to confirm the dx?,a. pcr for treponemal and non-treponemal antibiodies,b. dark ground microscopy from mouth ulcer,c. blood culture for treponema,d. dengue fever,,,,,,,key: the key is a. pcr for treponomal and non-treponemal antibodies.

This is because the patient exhibits classic signs of syphilis, including the maculopapular rash and mouth ulcers, as well as a recent penile ulcer. A positive non-treponemal antibody test indicates the possibility of syphilis, but it is not confirmatory alone. Therefore, a treponemal antibody test should also be done to confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, a negative treponemal test does not completely rule out syphilis as it can occur in resolved disease, which is confirmed by a positive non-treponemal test. Options B and C are incorrect because they do not specifically confirm a diagnosis of syphilis, and option D is completely unrelated.",a,a,TRUE,
"632. a 34yo man complains of arthralgia, abdominal pain and vomiting, a facial rash that is worse in the summer and hematuria. urea and creatinine are slightly elevated with urinalysis demonstrating red cell casts. pmh is remarkable for childhood eczema. which inv is most likely to lead to a dx?",a. us kub,b. joint aspiration,c. auto antibodies,d. ivu,e. renal biopsy,,,,,,key: the key is c. auto antibodies. [likely diagnosis is sle for which auto antibody (anti ds dna antibody) should be done].,"Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis for the 34-year-old man is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The correct answer for the most helpful investigation to confirm this diagnosis is C, autoantibodies. Specifically, an anti-dsDNA antibody test should be conducted as it is highly specific for SLE. The other options are less likely to confirm the diagnosis of SLE. US KUB and IVU would evaluate the urinary system, but they are not specific for SLE. Joint aspiration is more suitable for joint-related diagnoses, and renal biopsy is an invasive procedure that is not routinely performed as a first-line investigation. Therefore, an anti-dsDNA antibody test is the most appropriate initial investigation to confirm the diagnosis of SLE.",c,c,TRUE,
"633. a 56yo woman has had severe abdominal pain for 24h radiating to her back and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. she appears to be tachycardic and in shock. she was found to have gallstones, 2yrs ago. what is the most likely inv to confirm dx?",a. us abdomen,b. lft,c. serum lipase,d. angiography,e. ct abdomen,,,,,,key: the key is c. serum lipase. [the likely diagnosis is pancreatitis hence serum lipase].,"Given the patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain for 24 hours, radiating to the back, and accompanied by nausea and vomiting, along with her history of gallstones and presentation in shock, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis. As such, the most appropriate initial investigation to confirm this diagnosis would be serum lipase. Serum lipase levels are typically elevated in cases of acute pancreatitis, making it a reliable diagnostic test. An ultrasound of the abdomen may also be useful to visualize the pancreas and surrounding structures, but it is less sensitive and specific than serum lipase levels. Liver function tests (LFTs) may be useful to rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain, such as obstructive jaundice, but are not diagnostic of pancreatitis. Angiography and CT abdomen are typically reserved for more severe cases of pancreatitis or if complications are suspected. Therefore, the most likely inv to confirm dx in this patient is c. serum lipase.",c,c,TRUE,

[depends on the make up of the partner, ideally it's 1:2 since it's autosomal dominant with complete penetrance but if the patients spouse also has neurofibromatosis, it raises it to at least 75% with a possible 100%].","The correct answer is e. This is because the genetic condition being referred to is most likely neurofibromatosis, which is an autosomal dominant disorder with complete penetrance. Therefore, if one parent has the condition, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit it. However, the chances can vary depending on the genetic makeup of the partner. If the partner does not have neurofibromatosis, then the chances of the child inheriting it are 1:2. However, if the partner also has neurofibromatosis, then the chances increase to at least 75%, with a possible 100%. Thus, options a, b, and d are incorrect as they provide fixed ratios that do not take into account the partner's genetic makeup. Option c, stating that there is no genetic link, is also incorrect as neurofibromatosis is a genetic condition.",e,e,TRUE,

Acute conjunctivitis would present with redness of the conjunctiva, with no mention of swelling and purulent discharge. Acute iritis would present with severe eye pain and photophobia, while retrobulbar neuritis would have unexplained vision changes. Scleritis would present with severe pain and redness of the sclera. Hence, the most appropriate clinical diagnosis is acute dacrocystitis, which is an infection or blockage of the lacrimal sac leading to inflammation, redness, and swelling in the area around the eyelid.",b,b,TRUE,
636. a 60yo lady has severe chest pain. ecg shows changes of inferior wall mi. ecg also shows progressive prolongation of pr interval until a qrs complex is dropped. what is the most probable dx?,a. atrial fibrillation,b. vt,c. svt,d. mobitz type i 2nd degree heart block,e. mobitz type ii 2nd degree heart block,,,,,,key: the key is d. mobitz type i 2nd degree heart block. [inferior mi is frequently associated with conduction defect].,"The correct answer is d. Mobitz type I 2nd degree heart block. This type of heart block is characterized by a progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a QRS complex is dropped. It is frequently associated with inferior wall myocardial infarction (as in this case) and is typically caused by damage to the AV node. Other options such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia do not fit with the ECG findings described. Mobitz type II 2nd degree heart block is less common and is characterized by intermittent dropped beats without progressive PR prolongation.",d,d,TRUE,
637. a 52yo woman speaks rapidly without any pause and ignores interruptions. she doesn’t even pause to take enough breaths. what term best describes this kind of speech?,a. flight of ideas,b. broca’s aphasia,c. wernicke’s aphasia,d. pressure of speech,e. verbal dysphasia,,,,,,key: the key is d. pressure of speech.,"In this case, the correct answer is d. Pressure of speech. This term is used to describe rapid, continuous speech without pauses for air or interruptions. Flight of ideas, on the other hand, refers to a continuous flow of thoughts with rapid, often disjointed speech. Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia are language disorders that affect the ability to comprehend and produce language, respectively. Verbal dysphasia is a general term used to describe any language disorder. Therefore, pressure of speech is the most appropriate term to describe the woman's speech pattern.",d,d,TRUE,
638. a 30yo woman has been feeling low and having difficulty in concentrating since her mother passed away 2m ago. she feels lethargic and tends to have breathlessness and tremors from time to time. what is the most likely dx?,a. adjustment disorder,b. ptsd,c. panic disorder,d. gad,e. bereavement,,,,,,key: the key is a. adjustment disorder. [when 2 months passed it is no more normal bereavement but major depression or adjustment disorder].,"Based on the symptoms provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 30-year-old woman is option a, adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorder is a mental health condition that occurs when an individual struggles with adjusting to a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one. The symptoms mentioned, such as feeling low, having difficulty concentrating, lethargy, and experiencing physical symptoms like breathlessness and tremors, are common in individuals with adjustment disorders. PTSD, panic disorder, and GAD are all anxiety disorders that may present with similar symptoms, but they typically arise from different triggers and are not as closely linked to the death of a loved one as adjustment disorder. Bereavement is not considered a mental health diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the 30-year-old woman is adjustment disorder.",a,a,TRUE,
639. a 32yo man on psychiatric medications complains of inability to ejaculate. which drug is most likely to cause these symptoms?,a. lithium,b. haloperidol,c. chlorpromazine,d. fluoxetine,e. clozapine,,,,,,key: the key is d. fluoxetine. [ssris are frequently associated with delayed ejaculation].,"The correct answer is d. fluoxetine. Fluoxetine belongs to a class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which are frequently associated with delayed ejaculation. The other options listed, although they may have side effects related to sexual dysfunction, are not typically associated with delayed ejaculation. Lithium is primarily used as a mood stabilizer, haloperidol and chlorpromazine are antipsychotics, and clozapine is used to treat schizophrenia. Therefore, the most likely culprit for the patient's inability to ejaculate is fluoxetine.",d,d,TRUE,
640. a 4yo boy is brought by his parents with complains of wetting his bed at night and whenever he gets excited. what would be the most appropriate management for this child?,a. desmopressin,b. oxybutanin,c. behavioural therapy,d. tamsulosin,e. restrict fluid intake,,,,,,"key: the key is c. behavioural therapy. probably this is wrong option! there is no correct option for this question. [the question is inappropriate. child is of 4 yrs of age and before 5 yrs only reassurance, no treatment is indicated].","The question itself is inappropriate as the child is only 4 years old and reassurance is the only appropriate intervention at this age. None of the options provided are suitable treatments for a child of this age. Desmopressin and oxybutinin are medications used to manage bedwetting in older children and adults, while tamsulosin is used to treat prostate enlargement in men. Restricting fluid intake may lead to dehydration and its effectiveness for bedwetting is not well-established. Behavioral therapy may be appropriate for older children but not for a child as young as 4 years old. Therefore, it is important to reassure the parents and provide education about age-appropriate expectations for bedwetting, without the use of any medical intervention.",c,c,TRUE,
641. a 34yo dm pt is undergoing contrast radiography. what measure should be taken to prevent renal damage with contrast dye?,a. reduce contrast dye,b. plenty of fluids,c. nsaids,d. acei,e. iv dextrose,,,,,,key: the key is b. plenty of fluids.,"The correct answer is B: plenty of fluids. Contrast dye can cause damage to the kidneys by reducing blood flow and oxygen supply to the kidneys. Drinking plenty of fluids prior to and after the radiography procedure can help to flush out the contrast dye and prevent damage to the kidneys. 

Option A, reducing contrast dye, is not the correct answer as the amount of dye used is typically calculated based on the patient's weight and the procedure being performed, so reducing it may not be feasible. 

Option C, NSAIDs, is not recommended as some studies suggest that NSAIDs can increase the risk of kidney damage when used in conjunction with contrast dye. 

Option D, ACE inhibitors, should not be used in patients undergoing contrast radiography as they can potentially worsen kidney function. 

Option E, IV dextrose, has no relevance to preventing renal damage with contrast dye. 

Therefore, the most effective measure to prevent renal damage with contrast radiography is drinking plenty of fluids before and after the procedure.",b,b,TRUE,

[as the lesion is on the surface punch biopsy can be well obtained].,"The most appropriate investigation for the 75-year-old woman presenting with blood-stained discharge, dry skin over left areola, and an ulcerated nipple is a punch biopsy. A punch biopsy would be the best choice of investigation as the lesion is on the surface, and a sample can be easily obtained for analysis. FNAC, MRI, open biopsy, and stereotactic biopsy are unlikely to be useful in this case as they are either invasive or inappropriate for the type of lesion described. MRI is not indicated as it is not a primary method for diagnosing breast cancer. Open biopsy and stereotactic biopsy are invasive procedures and not suitable for this type of lesion as there is a risk of exacerbating her condition. In conclusion, a punch biopsy is the most appropriate choice of investigation in this case.",c,c,TRUE,

[it is a case of bipolar disorder. mainstay of treatment is mood stabilizers such as i) lithium carbonate ii) anticonvulsant medicines iii) antipsychotic medicines. so from the given options carbamazepine is the most appropriate drug].,"Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most appropriate drug to benefit him would be d. carbamazepine. The patient is presenting with symptoms of depression as well as a history of two episodes of increased activity, promiscuity, and aggressive behavior, which are consistent with symptoms of bipolar disorder. The mainstay of treatment for bipolar disorder is mood stabilizers, such as lithium carbonate, anticonvulsant medicines, and antipsychotic medicines. From the given options, carbamazepine is the most appropriate drug for the patient's condition. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that is used for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute psychosis, and Tourette's syndrome. Citalopram and desipramine are antidepressant medications that are used for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Ethosuximide is an antiepileptic medication that is used for the management of absence seizures. Thus, the most appropriate drug for the patient based on the symptoms and history presented would be carbamazepine.",d,d,TRUE,

[dizziness, nausea, vomiting and nystagmus which keep coming from time to time are common features of bppv].","The correct answer is c. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv). This is because the symptoms of dizziness, nausea, vomiting and nystagmus which keep coming from time to time are common features of bppv and are often triggered by sudden changes in posture. Panic disorder (a) may present with similar symptoms but is usually associated with anxiety attacks and is not triggered by changes in posture. Carotid sinus syncope (b) results from stimulation of the carotid sinus and is usually associated with syncope. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (d) results from compromised blood flow to the posterior part of the brain and presents with more severe and persistent symptoms. Postural hypotension (e) results from a sudden drop in blood pressure and presents with symptoms such as lightheadedness and syncope but is not associated with nystagmus or visual disturbances.",c,c,TRUE,

[acei and arb are known to raise the serum potassium level].,"The correct answer to the question is e. ramipril. This is because ACE inhibitors (such as ramipril) and ARBs (which are not listed as an option) are known to raise the serum potassium level, and the patient's potassium level is abnormally high (7.6, when the normal range is 3.5-5.0 mmol/L). The other medication choices (amlodipine, bendroflumethiazide, doxazosin, and atenolol) do not typically have this side effect and are therefore not likely to be responsible for the high potassium level. It is important to note that a potassium level this high is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate attention from a healthcare provider.",e,e,TRUE,
646. a 46yo woman has offensive yellow discharge from one nipple. she had a hx of breast abscess 3yrs ago. what is the possible dx?,a. duct papilloma,b. duct ectasia,c. duct fistula,d. breast cancer,,,,,,,key: the key is c. duct fistula.,"The most probable diagnosis for a 46-year-old woman with a history of breast abscess 3 years ago and offensive yellow discharge from one nipple is duct fistula. This condition occurs when a channel develops between the skin surface and a lactiferous duct, usually due to an abscess or infection. Duct papilloma and duct ectasia are less likely since they don't typically present with discharge. Breast cancer cannot be completely ruled out and should be considered in the differential diagnosis, but it's less probable given the patient's history and symptoms. However, further evaluation including imaging and possibly biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy.",c,c,TRUE,

[anti histone antibody is present in 95% cases of drug induced lupus].,"The correct answer to this question is c. anti-histone antibody. This is because anti-histone antibody is typically present in 95% of cases of drug-induced lupus, which can occur as a side effect of the medication used to treat TB. The symptoms described in the question, including malar rash, photosensitivity, and hematuria, are common among individuals with drug-induced lupus. The other antibody options listed (anti-ds DNA, anti-Sm, anti-La, and anti-centromere) are typically associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Sjogren's syndrome, and would not be the most likely positive antibody in this particular scenario. Therefore, anti-histone antibody is the single most likely positive antibody in this case due to the presenting symptoms and drug treatment history.",c,c,TRUE,

A 6-week-old child with profuse projectile vomiting is likely suffering from dehydration and must be rehydrated immediately. While options a, b, and c may be useful for diagnosing a potential underlying cause of the vomiting, they are not the primary concern at this time. Option d could potentially help to relieve vomiting but does not address the immediate need for hydration. Thus, administering IV fluids is the most urgent and appropriate action to take in this scenario.",e,e,TRUE,

[sleep disturbance, disinterest in sex and loss of appetite points towards the diagnosis of moderate depression].","The correct answer is b. moderate depression, as the patient exhibits symptoms such as sleep disturbance, disinterest in sex, and a loss of appetite, which are all indicative of moderate depression. Additionally, the patient's mood being worse at the beginning of the day also supports this diagnosis. The other choices are incorrect as mild depression typically involves fewer symptoms and less severe symptoms, severe depression involves more severe symptoms such as suicidal thoughts or attempts, low mood is a vague and non-specific term, and pseudo depression is not a recognized diagnosis. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and presentation, the most appropriate diagnosis is moderate depression.",b,b,TRUE,

[indications for ct are not fulfilled by given criteria. nice has mentioned x-ray skull is no more preferred over ct. hence answer for this question is d. reassurance].,"Based on the given scenario, the single most likely investigation that should be done is D. reassurance. This is because the physical examination showed no abnormalities, indicating that there is no major injury that needs to be investigated. Choosing A, skull xr, is an incorrect option since the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines do not recommend it as the preferred imaging modality for head injuries.

651. a lady with fam hx of ovarian carcinoma has a pelvis us that fails to reveal any abnormality. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. pelvic ct,b. ca 125,c. ca 153,d. laparoscopy,e. mri,,,,,,key: the key is b. ca 125. [ca 125 is tumour marker for ovarian tumour].,"The correct answer is b. Ca 125. Ca 125 is a tumour marker for ovarian cancer and can be elevated in some cases of ovarian tumours. In this scenario, since the pelvis ultrasound did not reveal any abnormalities, the next appropriate step would be to measure the Ca 125 levels in the blood to determine if there is a possibility of ovarian cancer. The other options, such as pelvic CT or MRI, may not provide enough information without clear evidence of an abnormality. Ca 153 is a tumour marker for breast cancer and would not be appropriate in this scenario. Laparoscopy is an invasive procedure and is not necessary at this stage if there is no evidence of an abnormality. Therefore, the single best investigation that should be carried out is measurement of Ca 125 levels in the blood.",b,b,TRUE,
652. a 10yo boy is taken to his gp by his parents with behavioural prbs. he attends a special school due to inappropriate behavior and during the interview with his parents the boy barks at infrequent episodes and shouts expletives. what is the most likely dx?,a. asperger syndrome,b. cotard syndrome,c. rett syndrome,d. ekbom syndrome,e. tourette’s syndrome,,,,,,"key: the key is e. tourette’s syndrome. [tourete’s syndrome may have motor tics like blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging. other complex motor tics may be sniffing, touching objects, hopping, jumping, bending or twisting. it has vocal tics like throat clearing, sniffing, grunting or barking and more complex like coprolalia (uttering socially inappropriate words) or echolalia (repeating the word or phrase of others)].","Based on the description provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 10-year-old boy is Tourette's syndrome (E). This disorder is characterized by both motor and vocal tics that are often difficult to control and can interfere with daily functioning. The boy's barking and shouting of expletives are examples of complex vocal tics, including coprolalia, that are commonly associated with Tourette's syndrome. Asperger syndrome (A) is a neurological disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication, but not usually associated with tics. Cotard syndrome (B) is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by nihilistic delusions, not behavioral problems and tics. Rett syndrome (C) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder that is usually only found in females. Ekbom syndrome (D), also known as delusional parasitosis, is a psychiatric disorder in which individuals have a fixed belief that they are infested with parasites despite lack of evidence.",e,e,TRUE,
"653. a 52yo male presents with sudden complete loss of vision from right eye. he also had been complaining of right sided headaches which would come up more on chewing. on fundoscopy, the retina was pale and a cherry red spot could be seen in the macular region. what caused this vision loss?",a. crao,b. crvo,c. branch rao,d. branch rvo,e. circumciliary vein occlusion,,,,,,key: the key is a. crao. [pale retina with cherry red spot in macular region is seen in crao].,"The correct answer is a. CRAO, or central retinal artery occlusion. The sudden complete loss of vision in the right eye, along with the presence of a pale retina and cherry red spot in the macular region on fundoscopy, are characteristic of CRAO. The presence of right-sided headaches that worsen with chewing is also consistent with temporal arteritis, a known risk factor for CRAO. CRVO, branch RAO, branch RVO, and circumciliary vein occlusion do not typically present with a cherry red spot and pale retina on fundoscopy and are unlikely causes of this patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's sudden loss of vision is CRAO.",a,a,TRUE,
"654. a 48yo woman presents with left-sided severe headache. she also has a red, watering eye and complains of seeing colored haloes in her vision. what is the most appropriate next step?",a. measure iop,b. relieve pain with aspirin,c. 100% oxygen,d. ct,e. relieve pain with sumatriptan,,,,,,key: the key is a. measure iop. [probable case of angle closure glaucoma requiring measurement of iop to establish the diagnosis].,"The correct answer for this question is a) measure IOP. The presenting symptoms suggest a possible case of angle closure glaucoma, which requires measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) to establish the diagnosis. Redness, watering of the eye, headache, and halos are typical symptoms of this condition. Option b, relieve pain with aspirin, may not be effective and could mask symptoms, delaying appropriate treatment. Option c, administering oxygen, is not indicated for this condition. Option d, CT scan, is not necessary at this time and would not diagnose angle closure glaucoma. Option e, relieve pain with sumatriptan, is not appropriate as the headache is likely secondary to elevated IOP and should only be treated after appropriate glaucoma therapy. Therefore, measuring IOP is the most appropriate next step in order to confirm the diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma and initiate treatment accordingly.",a,a,TRUE,

IV haloperidol. Primary sources such as patient.info, Wikipedia, and NHS recommend antipsychotics and, if necessary, an additional mood stabilizer as the first line of treatment for postpartum psychosis. As antipsychotics are given priority, haloperidol is the most likely correct answer. CBT may serve as a second line of defense, while reassurance and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) function as a last resort. Therefore, options a. fluoxetine and d. reassurance are both incorrect, but b. haloperidol is the best fit given the patient's symptoms and the recommended course of treatment.",b,b,TRUE,

[probable case of menieres disease. treated with prochlorperazine].,"The correct answer to this question is a. Buccal prochlorperazine. This is because the patient is showing symptoms of Meniere's disease, which is characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. Prochlorperazine is used to treat these symptoms as it has an anti-emetic effect and can reduce the severity of vertigo. Oral fluphenazine is an anti-psychotic drug that is not used to treat Meniere's disease. TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) are used to treat depression and anxiety but have no effect on Meniere's disease. Gentamicin patch on the round window is used for severe cases of Meniere's disease where other treatments have failed, but it can have serious side effects such as hearing loss and balance problems. The correct answer is a because it is the best drug treatment option for treating the symptoms of Meniere's disease in this particular patient.",a,a,TRUE,

[probable herpes zoster opthalmicus].,"The correct answer to this question is e. trigeminal nerve. The symptoms described in the prompt, including a painful rash on one side of the forehead and scalp, along with cornea lesions, are indicative of probable herpes zoster opthalmicus, a viral infection that affects the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The other options, such as the facial nerve, accessory nerve, olfactory nerve, and optic nerve, are not involved in these particular symptoms and do not match the clinical presentation described in the prompt.

This is because desensitization is considered as the treatment of choice in the long run. For prevention, the patient can be given propranolol before expected exposure, and if she presents with an attack, then rebreathing in a paper bag can be used to subside her acute problems. Diazepam and buspirone are not the recommended treatment for this condition. Therefore, it is crucial to use desensitization as an effective treatment strategy for the long-term management of this condition.",b,b,TRUE,

[prolonged rupture of membrane can lead to chorioamnionitis].,"The correct answer is b. chorioamnionitis, which is inflammation of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid. Prolonged rupture of membranes can lead to chorioamnionitis, which can cause uterine tenderness, fever, and elevated blood markers such as C-reactive protein and white blood cell count. It is important to recognize and treat chorioamnionitis promptly, as it can lead to serious complications for both the mother and baby, including preterm labor, sepsis, and fetal distress. Choices a, c, d, and e are unlikely given the patient's symptoms and history of prolonged rupture of membranes.",b,b,TRUE,

[chest pain, raised temperature and ecg findings of widespread st elevation with upwards concavity is diagnostic of acute pericarditis particularly after mi].","The most likely explanation for the abnormal ECG findings in this scenario is acute pericarditis (option a). This is because the patient has chest pain, a raised temperature, and the ECG findings of widespread ST elevation with upward concavity - all of which are characteristic of acute pericarditis, particularly after experiencing a heart attack. Cardiac tamponade (option b) is also a possible complication of a heart attack, but it typically presents with low blood pressure instead of a raised temperature. Atrial thrombus (option c) and left ventricular aneurysm (option d) may be complications of a heart attack but would not present with the same ECG findings as seen in this case. Dressler syndrome (option e) is also a possible complication of a heart attack, but it typically presents with different symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and pericardial effusion. Therefore, acute pericarditis is the most likely explanation for this patient's abnormal ECG findings.",a,a,TRUE,

The inguinal lymph nodes drain the scrotum and the skin of the lower abdominal wall. The other choices are incorrect because they do not drain the area where the ulcer is present. The external iliac lymph nodes drain the lower limb and pelvic region, the pre-aortic lymph nodes are located near the aorta and drain the abdominal organs, the aortic lymph nodes are located near the aorta and drain the abdominal organs, the iliac lymph nodes are located in the pelvic region and drain the lower limb, and the submental, submandibular, and deep cervical lymph nodes drain the head and neck region. It is important to correctly identify the lymph nodes involved for proper diagnosis and treatment.",d,d,TRUE,

[anti dna antibodies to diagnose sle].,"The most discriminative investigation for diagnosing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in a 35-year-old woman with butterfly rash on her face and symmetrical joint pains on the knee and elbow with a raised ESR would be anti-DNA antibodies, making answer choice A the correct option. This is because anti-DNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE and are commonly found in patients with active disease. Answer choice B (anti-Jo1 antibodies) is not relevant in this case as it is associated with polymyositis, which predominantly affects muscle weakness. Answer choice C (anti-nuclear antibodies) is a nonspecific marker for autoimmunity and is also commonly found in other autoimmune diseases, making it less discriminative for diagnosing SLE. Answer choice D (anti-centromere antibodies) is specific for CREST syndrome, a variant of systemic sclerosis and not associated with SLE. Lastly, answer choice E (anti-LA antibodies) is associated with Sjogren’s syndrome, another autoimmune disease, and not commonly found in SLE patients. Therefore, answer choice A is the most discriminative inv for dx in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
"663. pt had a fight following which he developed bleeding, ringing and hearing loss from one ear. what is the inv of choice?",a. ct,b. xr skull,c. otoscopy,d. mri vestibule,e. coagulation study,,,,,,key: the key is a. ct.  this is a wrong key! correct key is otoscopy.,"The correct answer to this question is c. otoscopy. The patient's symptoms of bleeding, ringing, and hearing loss from one ear after a fight suggest an injury or trauma to the ear. Otoscopy, which involves examining the ear canal and eardrum using a lighted instrument called an otoscope, is the most appropriate initial investigation to evaluate the cause and extent of the ear injury. A CT scan or MRI may be considered if further imaging is needed, but they are not the first-line investigations in this case. An X-ray of the skull is also not a relevant investigation for an ear injury, and a coagulation study is not relevant unless the patient has a bleeding disorder. In summary, otoscopy is the most appropriate investigation in this case to evaluate the extent and cause of the ear injury.",c,c,TRUE,
"664. a 35yo ivda (intra venous drug abuser) on penicillin and flucloxacillin for cellulitis now presents with jaundice, pale stools and dark urine. what is the single most likely dx?",a. hep a,b. cholestatic jaundice,c. chronic active hepatitis,d. primary biliary cirrhosis,e. hep b,,,,,,key: the key is b. cholestatic jaundice. [flucloxacillin can cause cholestatic jaundice].,"The correct answer to this question is b. Cholestatic jaundice. This is because the patient is an IV drug abuser and is taking flucloxacillin which is known to cause cholestatic jaundice. The presentation of pale stools and dark urine also point towards this diagnosis. Hepatitis A and B are viral infections that can cause jaundice, but in this case, there is no evidence to suggest viral hepatitis as the cause. Chronic active hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis are both chronic liver diseases which have a different clinical course and presentation to this acute episode. Therefore, cholestatic jaundice caused by flucloxacillin is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.",b,b,TRUE,
665. a 79yo woman has been dx with t2dm. her bmi=22. rbs are 8 and 10mmol/l. her bp=130/80mmhg. her fasting cholesterol=5.7mmol/l. she is currently symptom-free but has microalbuminuria. what is the single most appropriate drug management?,a. acei and glibenclamide,b. acei and metformin,c. statin and acei,d. statin and glibenclamide,e. statin and metformin,,,,,,key: the key is c. statin and acei. [diabetic patients are advocated statin irrespective of cholesterol levels and diabetic microalbuminuria is best treated by acei. as initially we shall give lifestyle advice and no medicine for diabetes even then we shall start with statin and acei].,"The single most appropriate drug management for the given scenario is option C, which is statin and acei. This is because diabetic patients are recommended to take statin irrespective of their cholesterol levels and diabetic microalbuminuria is best treated with acei. While the patient currently doesn't have any symptoms, her microalbuminuria requires immediate treatment. Moreover, the initial management of diabetes involves lifestyle advice and no medication, but when medication is required, statin and acei are the most appropriate drugs in this scenario. Options A, B, D, and E are inappropriate as they do not address the patient's microalbuminuria, which is a significant concern in diabetic patients.",c,c,TRUE,
666. a 68yo woman is unable to extend the ip joint of her right thumb 7wks following a fx of the right radius. other finger and thumb movements are normal. what is the single most likely tendon to be damaged?,a. abductor pollicis longus,b. extensor pollicis brevis,c. extensor pollicis longus,d. flexor digitorum profundus,e. flexor pollicis longus,,,,,,key: the key is c. extensor policis longus. [full extension of right thumb is achieved by extensor pollicis longus].,"The correct answer is c. extensor pollicis longus. The extensor pollicis longus is responsible for full extension of the thumb, which is the movement impaired in the described scenario. The abductor pollicis longus and flexor pollicis longus control abduction and flexion of the thumb, respectively, and are not involved in extension. The extensor pollicis brevis and flexor digitorum profundus control movements of the fingers, not the thumb. Therefore, a damage to extensor pollicis longus is the most likely cause of the inability to extend the IP joint of the right thumb in this woman.",c,c,TRUE,

[normal motor milestones indicate normal development but unable to respond to loud noise at 6 months may indicate deafness].,"The best management strategy for the 6-month-old son who is not responding to loud noises is to arrange a hearing test as suggested by option A. Although the baby's motor milestones are normal, the inability to respond to loud noise may indicate deafness, which is why the hearing test is a critical step in diagnosing any hearing problems. Assessing developmental milestones, as suggested in option B, may be useful in determining if the child is developing according to age norms but would not be sufficient to diagnose any hearing problems. Reassuring, as suggested in option C, would not be appropriate, as the mother's concern over her baby's inability to respond to loud noises is legitimate, and it is essential to rule out any hearing problems. Referring to a speech therapist or MRI brain, as suggested in options D and E, respectively, would not be appropriate as hearing problems could be the underlying cause of the baby's inability to respond to loud noises. Therefore, arranging a hearing test should be the best option to detect any hearing problems and choose the appropriate intervention strategy.",a,a,TRUE,

[the patient has copd and as no improvement with oxygen, next step is to check abg to give guidance for next treatment plan].","The correct answer for this question is C, check ABG. The patient presented with symptoms of persistent cough, sputum and dyspnea, and a history of smoking. These symptoms along with the history of smoking are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Administration of oxygen did not improve the patient's condition, therefore, checking arterial blood gases (ABG) would be the appropriate next step. This test will give guidance for the next treatment plan. Option A, prednisolone, is a corticosteroid medication that can be used to reduce inflammation and is often used in the treatment of COPD, but it would be premature to administer it without knowing the ABG values. Option B, salbutamol, is a bronchodilator medication used to improve airway obstruction. While it may relieve the symptoms, it would not address the underlying problem. Option D, CXR, and option E, ECG, do not provide the necessary information to guide the next treatment plan for COPD. By checking the ABG, the physician can determine the need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation and adjust oxygen levels to manage respiratory acidosis, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.",c,c,TRUE,

[age 65 yrs (vascular dementia is rare at age before 65), history of mi and stepwise decline of cognitive function indicates vasculopathy and hence vascular dementia].","The most likely diagnosis for this 66-year-old woman with a history of memory loss and a previous MI is vascular dementia (answer b). Vascular dementia is rare before the age of 65, but the patient's age and history of MI suggest the presence of vasculopathy, making vascular dementia a likely diagnosis. The stepwise decline of cognitive function is also indicative of vascular dementia. Alzheimer's disease (answer a) is a possibility, but the history of MI and stepwise decline make this less likely. Pick's dementia (answer c), Huntington's disease (answer d), and Lewy body dementia (answer e) are all less likely diagnoses as they do not fit with the patient's clinical history. In summary, based on this patient's age, previous MI, and stepwise decline in cognitive function, vascular dementia is the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

[features of heart failure and persistent st elevation suggests the dx of left ventricular aneurysm].,"The most likely explanation for the abnormal investigation is option d, left ventricular aneurysm. This is because the patient has features of heart failure and persistent ST elevation in leads V1-V4, which is suggestive of left ventricular aneurysm. Heart block (option a) could cause similar symptoms, but wouldn't explain the ST elevation. Right ventricular strain (option b) typically presents with ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, and wouldn't explain the patient's breathlessness. Atrial thrombus (option c) is unlikely to cause ST elevation and wouldn't explain the patient's heart failure symptoms. Dressler's syndrome (option e) typically presents with pericarditis and fever, neither of which is mentioned in the patient's history. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the abnormal investigation is left ventricular aneurysm.",d,d,TRUE,

[increasing jaundice at this age with failure to thrive, enlarged liver and scratches (itching) indicate cholestatic jaundice likely from biliary atresia].","Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis for the 4m girl is biliary atresia. The presence of increasing jaundice at such a young age, along with an enlarged liver and scratches on the skin, suggest cholestatic jaundice, which is commonly found in cases of biliary atresia. Moreover, the failure to thrive in this case is indicative of the liver not functioning properly. G6PD deficiency, hep B, and spherocytosis do not usually present with the same symptoms as biliary atresia, and therefore, are unlikely to be the correct diagnosis. It is essential to seek immediate medical attention for such a young infant with a potentially life-threatening condition like biliary atresia.",a,a,TRUE,
"672. a 76yo man suddenly collapsed and died. at post mortem exam, a retroperitoneal hematoma due to ruptured aortic aneurysm was noted. what is the most likely underlying cause of the aortic aneurysm?",a. atheroma,b. cystic medial necrosis,c. dissecting aneurysm,d. polyarteritis nodosa,e. syphilis,,,,,,key: the key is a. atheroma.,"The most likely underlying cause of the aortic aneurysm in this 76-year-old man who suddenly collapsed and died is atheroma, which is the correct answer. Atheroma is a buildup of plaque made of cholesterol, fat, calcium and other substances on the inner walls of arteries, which can weaken and enlarge the arterial wall, leading to an aneurysm. Cystic medial necrosis, dissecting aneurysm, polyarteritis nodosa, and syphilis are unlikely causes in this case as they are less common or present with different clinical pictures. Cystic medial necrosis is a connective tissue disorder that causes degeneration of the elastic fibers in the aortic wall, leading to aneurysm formation. Dissecting aneurysm is a result of a tear in the aortic wall that allows blood to enter between the layers and cause separation, whereas polyarteritis nodosa is a type of vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries. Syphilis may cause aortic aneurysm by causing inflammation that weakens the aortic wall. However, given this patient's age, atheroma is the most likely explanation for his aortic aneurysm.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the patient's symptoms are typical of stable angina, which is chest pain or discomfort that occurs during exertion or stress, and is relieved by rest or sublingual nitroglycerin. The pain typically lasts less than 30 minutes, and can be located in the chest, arm, neck, or jaw. Unstable angina (choice A) is characterized by severe, new-onset chest pain, or a change in the frequency, duration, or intensity of previously stable angina, and is a medical emergency. Decubitus angina (choice B) is chest pain that occurs while lying flat, and is relieved by sitting up or standing. Coronary spasm (choice D) is caused by a sudden narrowing of the coronary arteries, which can cause chest pain or a heart attack. Finally, MI (Myocardial Infarction) is a type of heart attack, which is characterized by damage to the heart muscle due to a lack of blood flow. In the given case, the symptoms are indicative of stable angina, and the patient should be advised to manage their risk factors and to undergo further diagnostic testing as needed.",c,c,TRUE,

[as patient is smoker, cocp should be avoided. in the given case option c. i.e. mirena is most suitable].","The most suitable management option for the patient's menorrhagia and contraceptive needs would be option c, iu/systemic progesterone. As the patient is a smoker, the use of cocp should be avoided due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Option b, grh analogues, may cause menopause-like symptoms and also do not provide contraceptive benefits. NSAIDs (option d) can be used as symptomatic relief for pain but do not provide long-term management of menorrhagia. Copper-containing IUCD (option e) can worsen heavy periods for some patients and may not be the best option for this patient's preference of minimal side effects. Therefore, option c, iu/systemic progesterone, is the most suitable management option for the patient's menorrhagia and contraceptive needs, as it provides long-term management with minimal side effects while also providing contraceptive benefits.",c,c,TRUE,

[in glue air there occur conductive deafness so the child watch tv with high volume and does not respond to others for this deafness].,"Based on the symptoms reported by the mother, it is likely that the child is experiencing conductive deafness. This would cause the child to watch TV at high volumes, avoid playing outside and become more withdrawn. Upon otoscopy, we would expect to see a bluish-grey tympanic membrane with air-fluid levels due to the presence of glue ear. This is the correct answer. Other options are less likely because they do not correspond to the reported symptoms. A flamingo pink tympanic membrane (answer choice a) would not explain the child's behavior, while an attic perforation (answer choice b) or inflamed tympanic membrane with a cartwheel appearance of vessels (answer choice d) would suggest acute otitis media, which is unlikely to cause the long-term symptoms reported.

[in cancer patient obstruction does not respond to medical treatment and hence diagnostic and therapeutic laparotomy is the option of choice].,"The correct answer in this scenario is option C, laparotomy. The patient underwent debulking surgery for ovarian carcinoma and now presents with signs of intestinal obstruction, which does not respond to medical treatment. In such cases, diagnostic and therapeutic laparotomy is often the option of choice as it allows for direct visualization of the abdominal organs. Pelvic CT and abdominal ultrasound may provide some information, but they are not as accurate as laparotomy. CA 125 is a tumor marker, which may be useful in monitoring response to treatment, but it is not a diagnostic tool for intestinal obstruction. Laparoscopy is also an option; however, it is less invasive than laparotomy and may not be suitable for all patients. Therefore, in this scenario, laparotomy is the single most appropriate investigation as it is likely to provide the most accurate diagnosis and may also offer a therapeutic benefit.",c,c,TRUE,
"677. a 45yo woman undergoing tx for ra for the last 5yrs presents with dizziness, easy fatigabiliy and lack of energy. a blood film shows mcv 106. what could be the most probable reason for her anemia?",a. steroids,b. chronic disease,c. nsaids,d. methotrexate,e. sulfasalazine,,,,,,key: the key is d. methotrexate. [methotrexate leads to folate deficiency anaemia].,"The correct answer is d. Methotrexate. Methotrexate can lead to folate deficiency anemia, which could explain the woman's symptoms of dizziness, easy fatigue, and lack of energy. Steroids and NSAIDs are not typically associated with anemia, and chronic disease alone is not a specific enough cause without further information about the woman's medical history. Sulfasalazine can sometimes cause anemia but is not as commonly associated with it as methotrexate. Therefore, the most probable reason for the woman's anemia is methotrexate.",d,d,TRUE,
678. a 62yo man who has recently had flu-like illness has woken to find his speech altered. movement of his eyelids and lips are weak on the right side. exam: normal. which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?,a. facial nerve,b. hypoglossal nerve,c. oculomotor nerve,d. trigeminal nerve,e. glossopharyngeal nerve,,,,,,key: the key is a. facial nerve. [viral infection is a common cause of facial nerve palsy].,"A 62-year-old man who has recently had a flu-like illness wakes up to find his speech altered and weakness in the movement of his eyelids and lips on the right side. Upon examination, it is found that his condition is caused by a viral infection and affects the facial nerve. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is a. facial nerve. The facial nerve is responsible for the movement of facial muscles, and facial nerve palsy is a common cause of weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles due to damage or inflammation of the facial nerve. The hypoglossal nerve, oculomotor nerve, trigeminal nerve, and glossopharyngeal nerve are not responsible for the movement of the facial muscles, and therefore they are not the anatomical site that is most likely to be affected in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
679. a 5yo girl has had an urti for 3 days and has been treated with paracetamol by her mother. for the last 12h she has been hot and irritable with severe pain in her right ear. what is the most likely dx?,a. herpes zoster infection,b. impacted ear wax,c. mumps,d. om,e. perforation of eardrum,,,,,,key: the key is d. om.,"The correct answer is d, otitis media (OM). This is the most likely diagnosis given the symptoms of severe pain in the right ear and a recent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). OM is a common complication of URTIs and is caused by an inflammation of the middle ear. The fluid build-up in the middle ear can cause pressure, pain, and sometimes fever. Herpes zoster infection, impacted ear wax, mumps, and perforation of the eardrum are less likely causes of the child's symptoms. Herpes zoster affects a nerve and causes painful blisters, impacted ear wax would not result in the severity of pain described, mumps usually causes swelling of the salivary glands and fever, and perforation of the eardrum would result in hearing loss or discharge from the ear. It is important for the child to be evaluated by a healthcare provider to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment.",d,d,TRUE,

[high temperature, cough with purulent sputum, pleuritic chest pain and herpes labialis are recognized feature of pneumococcal pneumonia (pneumococcus=gram +ve diplococci].","The correct answer is c. Gram +ve diplococci in sputum. This is because the patient is showing typical symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia, which is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a gram +ve diplococci. The presence of high fever, cough with purulent sputum, pleuritic chest pain, and herpes labialis are all recognized features of pneumococcal pneumonia. Choice a is incorrect because coagulase +ve cocci, such as Staphylococcus aureus, are not the main causative agents of pneumonia. Choice b is unlikely because gram -ve diplococci, such as Neisseria meningitidis, are associated with meningitis rather than pneumonia. Choice d is also incorrect because Pneumocystis carinii is a fungus that primarily affects immunocompromised patients and causes a different type of pneumonia. Finally, e is not the most likely answer because serology for Legionella is not a reliable diagnostic test for pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila, which is associated with a different set of symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[darkness can cause dilatation of pupil (which occurred in the darkness of theatre room) which (halfway dilatation) most often precipitate acute attack of angle closure glaucoma and the test to diagnose this is applanation tonometry].,"The correct answer is e, applanation tonometry. The presenting symptoms and exam findings suggest acute angle closure glaucoma, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. Darkness can cause dilatation of the pupil, particularly in patients with a predisposition to angle closure, which can precipitate an attack. Applanation tonometry measures intraocular pressure and is the gold standard for diagnosing glaucoma. CT head or MRI orbits may be ordered to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, but they are not the first-line investigation for a suspected angle closure glaucoma. Blood culture and sensitivity and toxicology screen are not indicated for this presentation. Therefore, the correct answer is e, applanation tonometry, as it will aid in the diagnosis and prompt treatment of acute angle closure glaucoma.",e,e,TRUE,

[here sudden unconciuosness without any provocation, which makes arrhythmia the most likely cause; hence we should do ecg].","In the case of an 82-year-old male who suddenly becomes unconscious and falls down, an ECG (electrocardiogram) is the best investigation to diagnose the cause of the episode. Because there was no provocation to the sudden unconsciousness, arrhythmia is the most likely cause. An ECG can detect abnormalities in heart rhythm and help determine if arrhythmia was the cause of the episode. The other choices, such as EEG (electroencephalogram), blood glucose level, CT (computed tomography), and CXR (chest x-ray) are not as relevant in the context of sudden unconsciousness as they are not the primary investigations to diagnose arrhythmia.",a,a,TRUE,
683. a child admitted with progressive muscle weakness and frequent falls. what is the most probable dx?,a. duchenne’s md,b. becker’s md,c. polymyositis,d. dermatomyositis,e. polymyalgia rheumatic,,,,,,key: the key is a. duchenne’s md.,"The most probable diagnosis for a child admitted with progressive muscle weakness and frequent falls is Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD). This is because DMD is the most common type of muscular dystrophy and it generally affects young boys between the ages of 3 and 5. The disease is characterized by the progressive weakening of the muscles, starting in the legs and pelvis and spreading throughout the body. The other options of Becker's muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and polymyalgia rheumatica are less likely because they do not typically present with such an early onset in children and are not commonly associated with frequent falls. Therefore, it is important to consider a thorough physical examination and genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.",a,a,TRUE,
684. a 56yo man presents to the ed with chest pain. the following ecg was taken. what is the most likely dx?,a. anterior mi,b. inferior mi,c. lateral mi,d. posterior mi,e. nstemi,,,,,,"key: the key is a. anterior mi. [here st elevation in l1, avl, v2,v3,v4 and v5. so the diagnosis is anterior mi (as l1 and avl and v2-v5, anterolateral would be more appropriate description)].","The correct answer is A) anterior MI. This is evident from the ST elevation seen in leads L1, AVL, V2-V5. These leads look at the anterior and anterolateral walls of the heart, which is consistent with an anterior MI. The other options are less likely because they involve different areas of the heart. B) Inferior MI would show ST elevation in II, III and aVF leads; C) Lateral MI would show ST elevation in leads I and V6, along with AVL and V5-V6; D) Posterior MI is usually diagnosed by reciprocal change in V1-V2 or ST depression in V1-V2 along with ST elevation in posterior leads V7-V9; and E) NSTE-ACS will have non-specific ST-T changes, which is not the case here.",a,a,TRUE,

[the rhymic use of words as described is known as clanging or clang association often seen in schizophrenia].,"The correct answer for this question would be e. clang association. Clanging is a type of thought disorder that is often witnessed in individuals with schizophrenia. It is characterized by the use of rhyming words or the sound of words rather than their actual meaning. In this case, the individual's speech can be observed to go off on tangents, with the word association being based solely on the sound of the word rather than its meaning. This is exemplified by the reference to ""fairs"" in the statement, which was followed by ""it must be good"" without any clear connection. The other choices given in the question are incorrect as they do not fit the symptoms of the individual in question. Neologism refers to the creation of new words or phrases, flight of ideas involves rapid shifts in the conversation, Broca's aphasia affects speech production, and Wernicke's aphasia affects language comprehension.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because the patient is likely suffering from a ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. By raising the patient's blood pressure to 90mmHg, vital organs can continue to be perfused until definitive measures can be taken. Urgent abdominal CT or US may be needed to confirm the suspected diagnosis, but administering IV fluids is the priority in order to stabilize the patient. Choices D and E are incorrect as they suggest raising the SBP to either 120mmHg or using dopamine injection, which may further complicate the patient's condition.",c,c,TRUE,

Women near menopause are more commonly affected by duct ectasia and typically present with brown, green or cheesy discharge. Unlike other options such as duct papilloma, intra-ductal papilloma, mammary duct fistula, and breast abscess, duct ectasia is harmless and tends to clear up without treatment. Therefore, option C is the correct answer, while the other choices are unlikely diagnoses and are associated with different clinical features and management.",c,c,TRUE,

IgA nephropathy. The presence of hematuria, proteinuria 10g/24h, and low albumin levels are indicative of a renal disease. The history of URTI and hematuria point towards IgA nephropathy. The differential diagnosis for rapidly progressive GN is ruled out, as this condition lasts for more than ten days, whereas IgA nephropathy lasts for less than ten days.

Even though both cyclizine and prochlorperazine can be used for Meniere's disease, cyclizine is the first line treatment due to its potency and effectiveness. Buccal prochlorperazine is listed as the 2nd line of treatment. Metachlorpromide, cotrimazole, and ondansetron are not appropriate treatments for Meniere's disease and do not address the symptoms of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, and hearing loss. Thus, the best option for this patient's condition is the use of cyclizine.",c,c,TRUE,

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause respiratory infections, including pneumonia. It is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia in children and young adultsMycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are both bacteria that can cause atypical pneumonia, also known as  walking pneumonia  1. Atypical pneumonia is a type of pneumonia that is not caused by the more common bacteria that cause typical pneumonia, and its symptoms can be milder and more flu-like compared to typical pneumonia 1. While both Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila can cause similar symptoms, there are some differences in their clinical presentation and risk factors that can help differentiate between the two.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is more common in children and young adults, and is often associated with outbreaks in crowded settings such as schools and military barracks. The symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can include fever, headache, malaise, dry cough, and chest pain. A chest X-ray often shows bilateral reticulonodular or patchy consolidation in both lower lobes.

Legionella pneumophila is more common in older adults, smokers, and people with chronic lung disease or weakened immune systems. It is often associated with exposure to contaminated water sources such as hot tubs, plumbing systems, and cooling towers 2.

This test is appropriate for a child with increasing jaundice and pale stools as it measures levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes, indicating if there is any liver damage or dysfunction. Endomyseal antibodies (a) are tested for celiac disease, sweat test (b) is for cystic fibrosis, and TFT (c) is for thyroid function. US (e) may show dilatation of common bile duct or stones, but it does not determine the cause of jaundice. Therefore, LFT is the most appropriate test in this case.",d,d,corrected,

[the extensor digitorum extends the phalanges, then the wrist, and finally the elbow. it acts principally on the proximal phalanges].","The correct answer is c. extensor digitorum. Given the patient's age and history of rheumatoid arthritis, the extensor digitorum tendon is the most likely to have been damaged due to weakening of the tendons. The extensor carpi radialis and ulnaris tendons primarily extend the wrist and not the fingers while the flexor digitorum profundum is responsible for flexing the fingers and not extending them. The extensor indicis is a minor extensor of the fingers and is unlikely to be the most likely tendon damaged in this scenario. Therefore, based on the given information, the extensor digitorum is the most likely tendon to have been damaged due to its role in extending the fingers, making option c the correct choice.",c,c,TRUE,

This is indicated by the patient's postoperative inability to pass urine and the presence of tenderness in the left flank and suprapubic region. These symptoms suggest some damage has occurred to the urinary tract during the cesarean section procedure. UTI and acute pyelonephritis would present with different symptoms, such as fever and urinary tract discomfort. Pleurisy is inflammation of the lungs, which would not account for the patient's urinary symptoms or abdominal distention. Paralytic ileus is a possible complication of surgical procedures, but this does not explain the patient's urinary symptoms or left flank tenderness.",b,b,TRUE,

Based on the history provided, the most likely diagnosis is a subdural haematoma. A CT scan can easily detect this condition and allow for prompt treatment. Xr skull (option A) and Xr face (option B) are not appropriate initial investigations as they are less likely to detect subdural haematoma. MRI brain (option D) may provide more detailed imaging, but is not the most appropriate initial investigation as it is less readily available and also less sensitive for detecting bleeding. EEG (option E) may be useful in some cases of head injury, however, it is not an appropriate initial investigation for this patient. Therefore, a CT scan of the brain is the most appropriate initial investigation in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,

HSP or Henoch-Schönlein purpura. The characteristic non-blanching rash on the legs, arthritis, and absence of fever are all consistent with HSP, which typically occurs in children under 10 years old. Moreover, the lab results show a platelet count within the normal range, ruling out ITP or TTP, as well as the absence of bleeding or prolonged clotting times, making hemophilia and meningitis septicemia less likely. In summary, based on the symptoms and lab findings, HSP is the most likely diagnosis for this 4-year-old boy.",c,c,TRUE,

This medication is commonly used to treat infections caused by anaerobic bacteria, including those that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, flatulence, and weight loss. Metronidazole is effective because it targets the DNA of the bacteria, preventing them from reproducing and allowing the body's immune system to fight off the infection. The other choices (b. fluconazole, c. vancomycin, d. amoxicillin) are not appropriate in this situation as they target different types of infections or bacteria. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication, vancomycin is used for severe bacterial infections such as MRSA, and amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that may not be effective against the anaerobic bacteria causing the symptoms. Therefore, the most important treatment for this young man's symptoms would be metronidazole.",a,a,TRUE,

This is a medical emergency as it can rapidly progress to airway obstruction. Clinical features of acute epiglottitis include high fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and respiratory distress. The thumb sign seen on the neck X-ray is a classic radiographic finding in acute epiglottitis. Croup (Option A) and upper respiratory tract infection (Option B) may also present with stridor but are less severe and do not typically have drooling of saliva or a thumb sign on X-ray. Diphtheria (Option C) is rare in developed countries due to vaccination and presents with a grayish-white membrane in the throat but does not typically cause drooling. Rapid management of acute epiglottitis with airway support and antibiotics is essential to prevent respiratory failure.",d,d,TRUE,

[probable enlarged adenoid].,"The correct answer is c. Referring the child to an ENT surgeon would be the best management strategy as the symptoms described, including indistinct nasal speech, snoring at night, and restless sleep, suggest that the child may have an enlarged adenoid. This can lead to obstructive sleep apnea and fatigue during the day, making it important to seek medical evaluation and management. Assessing development milestones and arranging a hearing test may be important in a broader context, but in this specific scenario, referring to an ENT surgeon takes priority.

[this is a case of testicular torsion which needs urgent diagnostic and therapeutic surgical exploration of the scrotum].,"The correct answer to this question is d. surgical exploration of scrotum. This is because the patient's symptoms and history suggest testicular torsion, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention. Needle aspiration of the scrotum, urinary test for hematuria, and MSU (midstream urine) test are not appropriate in this case as they do not provide sufficient information to diagnose or treat testicular torsion. Ultrasound of the scrotum is a useful tool in the diagnosis of testicular torsion, but it may not be immediately available or definitive enough to warrant delay in surgical exploration. Therefore, the most appropriate way to diagnose testicular torsion, which is a potentially life-threatening condition, is to perform surgical exploration of the scrotum.",d,d,TRUE,

Pancoast tumor. The patient's symptoms of hoarseness of voice and drooping eyelid are due to the compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the sympathetic ganglion, respectively, which are both common presentations of Pancoast tumors. The palpable mass in the right supraclavicular fossa is also indicative of involvement of the supraclavicular lymph node, which is often seen in Pancoast tumors. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking for the last 30 years further supports the diagnosis of a malignancy, and Pancoast tumor is a common cancer associated with smoking. Carcinoma larynx, carcinoma thyroid, and mesothelioma do not typically present with the same symptoms as Pancoast tumor, and carcinoma right bronchus may present with similar symptoms but is less likely due to the palpable mass in the right supraclavicular fossa. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Pancoast tumor.",e,e,TRUE,

Specifically, the fixed dose of fentanyl patches is recommended because it releases the required dose for a given period. While the use of parenteral morphine is the next step as per pain ladder, the lack of correct dose options results in the choice of fentanyl patches. Morphine 60mg state and tds options are not appropriate since the patient is unable to swallow. Similarly, oxycodone 10mg od is not an appropriate medication to use when dealing with pain that was previously controlled by a higher dose of morphine. Ultimately, the best course of action is to use fentanyl patches to manage the patient's pain effectively.",e,e,TRUE,

[chrommoglycate should be used in exercise induced asthma if salbutamol and steroids fail]. [this question is not appropriate as single most appropriate treatment to add or to chose from given options is not clear].,"The correct answer to this question is b. regular salbutamol and budesonide. While sodium chromoglycate can be used in exercise-induced asthma if salbutamol and steroids fail, it is not the single most appropriate treatment in this case. The addition of budesonide, an inhaled steroid, can help to reduce inflammation in the airways, while regular use of salbutamol can provide immediate relief during exercise-induced attacks. Oral steroids such as the one listed in choice d are not typically recommended for exercise-induced asthma. However, it should be noted that this question is not entirely clear on the single most appropriate treatment to add or choose, as various factors such as the severity of the asthma and the patient's medical history may need to be considered.",c,c,TRUE,

[a case of mumps. self limiting condition].,"The correct answer is e reassurance. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a case of mumps, a self-limiting viral infection that typically resolves within a couple of weeks without any specific treatment. In this case, prescribing analgesics may provide symptomatic relief but would not address the underlying cause. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections such as mumps, and a biopsy or immediate surgery is not necessary for this condition. Instead, reassurance and supportive care, such as ensuring adequate hydration, rest, and pain relief, are the most appropriate next steps.",e,e,TRUE,

The key, ""The key is E. Us kub,"" mentions that further extension beyond the capsule can cause obstruction of ureters, leading to ARF, loin pain, and symptoms of chronic kidney disease. Option A, MRI spine, and option B, radionuclide bone scan, are not appropriate in this case since they do not evaluate the kidneys or ureters. Option C, transrectal US, is used to evaluate the prostate and does not assess the kidney or ureters. Similarly, option D, US pelvis, is used to assess the pelvic organs and does not help evaluate the kidney or ureters. Therefore, option E, US KUB, is the most appropriate next investigation to evaluate the kidneys and ureters in this case of ARF due to adenocarcinoma of the prostate.",e,e,TRUE,

[sudden onset, severe abdominal pain, rigidity, left iliac fossa pain and fever are in favour of perforated diverticulum].","Based on the provided symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is perforated diverticulum, represented by option D. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, rigidity, left iliac fossa pain, and fever are all in favor of this diagnosis. The other options can be ruled out due to the nature of the symptoms. Intussusception would typically present with colicky abdominal pain, while ischemic colon would show signs of rectal bleeding. Sigmoid volvulus would cause distension of the abdomen and constipation, and perforated Meckel's diverticulum is less common in older adults. Therefore, based on the presented symptoms and potential diagnoses, the most likely diagnosis is a perforated diverticulum.",d,d,TRUE,

[the given symptoms are classic presentation of hypothyroidism (cardiac murmur though is not that common)].,"Based on the given symptoms, the single most likely diagnosis for the 46-year-old woman is hypothyroidism. The presenting symptoms of weight gain, sensitivity to cold, and a slow heart rate are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland. Additionally, the enlargement of the heart with a murmur is a possible complication of untreated hypothyroidism. The other options, including hyperthyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, Addison’s disease, and pheochromocytoma, do not fit the presented symptoms. Hyperthyroidism typically results in weight loss, sensitivity to heat, and a rapid heartbeat. Cushing’s syndrome and Addison’s disease involve the dysfunction of the adrenal glands and do not typically present with cardiac symptoms. Pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland, typically presents with high blood pressure and heart palpitations. Therefore, hypothyroidism is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

[a case of delirium tremens. treated with benzodiazepines like chlordiazepoxide or diazepam].,"The correct answer to this question is b. diazepam. This is because the alcoholic in question is likely suffering from delirium tremens, which is a severe withdrawal symptom that can cause hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine medication, is a commonly used treatment for delirium tremens, as it helps to calm the nervous system and reduce the severity of symptoms. Olanzapine, acamprosate, disulfiram, and haloperidol are all treatments that are used in different contexts or for different conditions, and would not be appropriate for this specific case of delirium tremens. Therefore, the correct answer is diazepam.",b,b,TRUE,

[relapse may directly involve testis and excisional biopsy is done to confirm recurrence of leukemia]. ref: link: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jco.2009.23.8014,"The correct answer for this scenario is c. biopsy. This is because the enlarged left scrotum may indicate that the relapse has directly involved the testis. In such cases, an excisional biopsy is done to confirm the recurrence of leukemia. The other answer choices are incorrect because herniotomy is a surgical procedure to repair a hernia and would not address the underlying issue of the enlarged scrotum. CT abdomen may provide information about abdominal lymph nodes or solid organ involvement, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Immediate surgery without obtaining a biopsy may lead to unnecessary surgical intervention and may not provide a definitive diagnosis. Reassurance alone is not appropriate because the enlarged scrotum may be indicative of recurrence of leukemia, and prompt intervention is necessary. In conclusion, obtaining a biopsy is the most appropriate next step for a 6-year-old boy who has completed an induction course of chemotherapy for all and has an enlarged left scrotum.",b,b,TRUE,

[the diagnosis is rhabdomyolysis. so iv fluid is the next appropriate step].,"Based on the information provided, the next appropriate step would be to administer a fluid challenge. The reddish brown urine obtained from the bladder catheter suggests the presence of myoglobin from damaged muscles, indicating rhabdomyolysis as a possible diagnosis. In this case, administering IV fluids would help to prevent kidney damage and facilitate the removal of myoglobin from the bloodstream. Dopamine IV, furosemide IV, and 20% mannitol IV are not appropriate choices as they do not address the underlying issue of rhabdomyolysis and may even worsen the patient's condition. Antibiotics are also not appropriate as there is no evidence of infection. Therefore, the best choice is a fluid challenge to help support the patient's fluid balance and prevent further complications.",b,b,TRUE,

[thiazide diuretics causes hyperuicemia which can precipitate acute attack of gout].,"The correct answer to this question is e. Serum uric acid. This is because the patient's symptoms suggest an acute attack of gout, which is a condition caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. Thiazide diuretics, like the one this patient is taking, can cause hyperuricemia or elevated uric acid levels in the blood. This can precipitate an acute attack of gout, especially in patients with a history of gout or high levels of uric acid. Blood culture, CRP, and D-dimer are not appropriate diagnostic tests for gout and would not provide useful information in this case. An X-ray of the knee may be helpful to rule out other possible causes of joint pain, but it would not be the single most appropriate diagnostic test for gout. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnostic test in this case is serum uric acid to confirm the diagnosis of gout and help guide treatment.",e,e,TRUE,
"713. a 27yo woman with anxiety and weight loss has tachycardia, tremor and mild proptosis. what single mechanism accounts for her weight loss?",a. deficiency in thyroid hormone,b. increased level of calcitonin,c. increased metabolic rate,d. insulin resistance,e. reduced caloric intake,,,,,,key: the key is c. increased metabolic rate. [the given features are of thyrotoxicosis in which increased metabolism causes loss of patients weight].,"The correct answer to the question is c. Increased metabolic rate. The given features of the patient, such as tachycardia, tremor, and mild proptosis, along with weight loss and anxiety, suggest an overactive thyroid gland, a condition known as thyrotoxicosis. In this condition, excessive thyroid hormone is secreted, leading to an increased metabolic rate and subsequent weight loss. Therefore, the single mechanism that accounts for the patient's weight loss is an increased metabolic rate. 

Option a, deficiency in thyroid hormone, is incorrect because in thyrotoxicosis, the thyroid gland produces an excess of thyroid hormone, resulting in hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Option b, increased level of calcitonin, is also incorrect because calcitonin is secreted by the thyroid gland, but its primary function is to lower blood calcium levels, and it is not involved in weight loss. Option d, insulin resistance, is not directly related to weight loss. Finally, option e, reduced caloric intake, might also lead to weight loss, but the given symptoms suggest an underlying medical condition. Hence, option c is the correct answer that explains the mechanism behind the woman's weight loss.",c,c,TRUE,

[for cancer or chemotherapy induced vomiting ondensatron is the drug of choice. as here vomiting is intractable im ondensatron should be given not oral].,"The most appropriate management for a man with carcinoma and multiple metastasis who presents with intractable nausea and vomiting, and has become drowsy and confused would be to administer ondansetron via intramuscular injection. Ondansetron is the drug of choice for chemotherapy or cancer-induced vomiting and since the vomiting in this case is intractable, it should be given through an injectable route rather than orally. Dexamethasone, though useful in reducing inflammation and controlling nausea and vomiting, is not the drug of choice in this scenario. Morphine, on the other hand, is an inappropriate option as it can further depress the patient's level of consciousness and worsen his drowsiness and confusion. The correct answer, ondansetron IM, would help alleviate the patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting without the risk of further impairing his mental status.",c,c,TRUE,

[key features of mody are: being diagnosed with diabetes under the age of 25 and having a parent with diabetes, with diabetes in two or more generations].","Based on the symptoms presented and the patient's family history, the most likely type of DM this patient suffers from is MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young). This is because MODY is typically diagnosed under the age of 25 and there is a strong family history of diabetes in two or more generations. While IDDM (Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) and NIDDM (Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) are other types of diabetes, they typically present at a later age and do not have as strong of a genetic link as MODY. LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adulthood) is a type of diabetes that presents in adulthood and has autoimmune features, whereas MODY does not. DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) is not a type of diabetes, but rather a complication that can occur in people with diabetes when their blood sugar gets too high and their bodies produce ketones. Therefore, the answer is D, MODY, as it best fits the patient's presentation and family history.",d,d,TRUE,

The patient's medical history indicates a diagnosis of ADPKD, which is best diagnosed through US KUB. The features of hypertension, abdominal pain, and renal failure are typical of ADPKD, and US KUB is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis. CT brain and IVU are not relevant to diagnosing ADPKD, while renal artery doppler and renal biopsy are invasive procedures that are not typically used for diagnosing ADPKD. In summary, the most appropriate investigation to diagnose this patient's condition would be US KUB.",a,a,TRUE,

When a post gastric ulcer perforates, the fluid will accumulate in the lesser sac, which is located behind the stomach and in front of the pancreas. The lesser sac is a potential space in the peritoneal cavity that can collect fluid from a perforation. The other choices are incorrect because the left and right paracolic gutters are located on the sides of the abdomen, the pelvic cavity is below the abdomen, and under the diaphragm is above the stomach. Therefore, fluid from a perforation would not accumulate in these areas.",c,c,TRUE,

[in korsakoff psychosis there is confabulation (a memory disturbance, defined as the production of fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without the conscious intention to deceive) which may present like this].","The most likely diagnosis for the 62-year-old male with persistent lying and a history of alcoholism is D, Korsakoff psychosis. This condition is characterized by confabulation, which is a memory disturbance where the patient produces fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories without the intention to deceive. In this case, the patient denies any memory problems, but his daughter contradicts his statements, suggesting he is lying. Other options, such as Ganser syndrome, Cotard syndrome, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and alcohol withdrawal, do not fit the patient’s symptoms and history. Ganser syndrome involves giving approximate but incorrect answers to questions, Cotard syndrome involves nihilistic delusions, Wernicke’s encephalopathy involves confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, and alcohol withdrawal involves physical symptoms such as tremors and seizures. Therefore, based on the patient’s symptoms and history, Korsakoff psychosis is the most likely diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,

[proximal muscle weakness (inability to climb the stairs) and raised cpk points towards polymyositis].,"Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 70-year-old man is polymyositis (answer a). The presentation of proximal muscle weakness and inability to climb the stairs along with the raised creatine kinase (CPK) levels strongly suggest an inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis. Polymyalgia rheumatica (answer b) is characterized by pain and stiffness in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and hips, but without muscle weakness or elevated CPK levels. Reactive arthritis (answer c) is an inflammation of the joints caused by a bacterial infection, and would be unlikely in this case as the patient’s primary complaint is not joint pain. RS (answer d) is not a recognized medical condition, and Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (answer e) is a genetic disorder that usually presents in childhood, making it unlikely in this older patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the presentation and laboratory results is polymyositis.",a,a,TRUE,

[this is a case of wernicke’s encephalopathy which is treated with vit b complex].,"The correct answer for this question is e. vit b complex. The patient is showing symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy which is commonly observed in alcoholics due to thiamine deficiency. Treatment with vitamin B complex helps to replenish the thiamine stores and improve neurological symptoms. Antibiotics, glucose, and IV fluids are not viable options to treat Wernicke's encephalopathy. Disulfiram is used to treat alcohol dependence and cannot be used for treating the symptoms observed in this patient. To treat Wernicke's encephalopathy, addressing the thiamine deficiency by administering vitamin B complex is essential.",e,e,TRUE,
721. a pt suffering from schizophrenia laughs while talking about his father’s death. which term best describes his condition?,a. depression,b. flat affect,c. emotional liability,d. incongruent affect,e. clang association,,,,,,key: the key is d. incongruent affect. [incongruent affect means inappropriate emotional response like loughing hearing a sad news or crying hearing a good news].,"The correct answer is d. incongruent affect. The term incongruent affect refers to an inappropriate emotional response that does not match the situation or context. In this case, the patient with schizophrenia is laughing while discussing a sad event, which is a classic example of incongruent affect. Option a, depression, would not be the correct choice because laughter is not typically associated with depression. Option b, flat affect, refers to a lack of emotional expression, which is not present in this scenario as the patient is displaying an emotional response. Option c, emotional liability, refers to rapid and inappropriate changes in emotional expression, which is not present in this scenario. Lastly, option e, clang association has nothing to do with emotions and is not relevant to this scenario. In conclusion, the most appropriate term to describe the patient's condition is incongruent affect.",d,d,TRUE,
722. a 72yo man has been on warfarin for 2yrs because of past tias and strokes. what is the most imp complication the pt should be careful with?,a. headache,b. osteoporosis,c. ear infection,d. limb ischemia,e. diarrhea,,,,,,key: the key is b. osteoporosis. it is a wrong key. the correct option is a. headache. [headache from intracranial hemorrhage is more important complication about which patient should be careful with (it is more important than osteoporosis)].,"The correct answer to the question of what is the most important complication a 72-year-old man on warfarin should be careful with is a. headache. Although osteoporosis is a potential complication with long-term warfarin use, it is not as important as headache from intracranial hemorrhage. This is because intracranial hemorrhage can be life-threatening, whereas osteoporosis is a chronic condition that can be managed. Ear infection, limb ischemia, and diarrhea are not common complications of warfarin use and do not require as much caution as headache from intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, patients on warfarin must take necessary precautions to detect and treat any signs of headache to avoid any serious consequences.",a,a,TRUE,
"723. a 24yo woman is afraid to leave her house as whenever she goes out, she tends to have sob and sweating. she has stopped going out except with her husband. what is the most likely dx?",a. social phobia,b. claustrophobia,c. depression,d. panic disorder,e. agoraphobia,,,,,,key: the key is e. agoraphobia. [agoraphobia: extreme or irrational fear of open or public places].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 24-year-old woman described in the question is e. agoraphobia. This is because her fear of leaving her house and the physical symptoms she experiences when she does so is indicative of an extreme or irrational fear of open or public places, which is a defining characteristic of agoraphobia. Social phobia, claustrophobia, and panic disorder may all involve fear or avoidance of certain situations, but they do not explain the specific symptoms and behavior described in this case. Depression may cause social withdrawal, but it does not necessarily involve fear or avoidance of specific situations. Therefore, based on the information provided, agoraphobia is the most likely diagnosis.",e,e,TRUE,

[both ramipril and losartan can cause hyperkalemia].,"The correct answer to this question is a. Ramipril. Both Ramipril and Losartan can cause hyperkalemia, but Ramipril has a higher likelihood of doing so. Thiazide, Nifedipine, and Furosemide are not associated with hyperkalemia. It is important to note that hyperkalemia can have serious consequences and requires prompt medical attention. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to monitor patients on these medications for hyperkalemia regularly.",a,a,TRUE,
725. a young man develops itching worse at night and following bathing. exam: greysish white linear rash can be seen on the wrist and periumbilical area. what is the dx?,a. scabies,b. polycythemia,c. urticarial,d. atopic eczema,e. lichen planus,,,,,,key: the key is a. scabies.,"The correct answer is a. scabies. Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The symptoms include intense itching, especially at night, and a distinct rash that appears as small red bumps or blisters. The rash may be accompanied by linear tracks or burrows, which are caused by the mites burrowing into the skin to lay eggs. The wrist and periumbilical area are common sites for these burrows. Polycythemia is a medical condition characterized by an excess of red blood cells in the bloodstream. Urticarial is a type of skin rash that is usually caused by an allergic reaction. Atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes red, itchy, and inflamed skin patches. Lichen planus is a rare inflammatory skin condition that usually appears as shiny, flat-topped bumps that may be itchy and painful. Therefore, scabies is the correct diagnosis for the presented symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,
726. a 40yo lady who has been a smoker since she was a teenager has the following blood result: hgb=19. what hormone should you check?,a. aldosterone,b. cortisol,c. erythropoietin,d. t4,e. tsh,,,,,,key: the key is c. erythropoetin. [smoking causes raised carboxyhemoglobin level causing hypoxemia and raised erythropoeitin which leads to raised hemoglobin level (secondary polycythemia)].,"The correct answer is c. erythropoietin. Smoking can cause an increase in carboxyhemoglobin levels, which can lead to hypoxemia and subsequently a rise in erythropoietin. This increase in erythropoietin can cause secondary polycythemia, which means elevated levels of hemoglobin in the blood. Therefore, checking the erythropoietin levels is the appropriate hormone to check in this scenario. The other choices, such as aldosterone, cortisol, T4, and TSH are not relevant to this particular situation as they do not play a role in the regulation of erythropoiesis.",c,c,TRUE,
727. a 25yo man presents with hoarseness of voice. he has swollen vocal cords. his bmi=32 and he smokes 20-25 cigarettes/day. what would you advise him?,a. stop smoking,b. lose weight,,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. stop smoking.,"The correct answer in this case would be a, which is to advise the patient to stop smoking. This advice is given because the smoking habit is most likely the cause of the symptoms that the man is experiencing, including hoarseness of voice and swollen vocal cords. Additionally, smoking is a major risk factor for a plethora of health problems, including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, which can be catastrophic in the long run. The other choice, which is to lose weight, is not necessarily wrong, but it is not the best advice in this scenario. While losing weight can certainly have a positive impact on overall health and reduce the risk of certain conditions, it is not directly related to the symptoms that the man is experiencing. Therefore, stopping smoking is the most effective course of action to address the root of the problem and prevent further health complications in the future.",a,a,TRUE,
"728. a 64yo male was admitted to the medical ward with complaint of diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss for few months. exam: clubbing, perianal skin tags and abdominal tenderness. colonscopy reveals transmural granulomatous inflammation involving ileocecal junction. he was dx with what?",a. cd,b. uc,c. bowel cancer,d. gastric cancer,e. ibd,,,,,,key: the key is a. cd. [the given picture is typical of crohn’s disease].,"The correct answer is A, Crohn's disease. This diagnosis is based on a combination of the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and colonoscopy results. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and other symptoms. It is characterized by transmural inflammation and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is another type of IBD, but it primarily affects the colon and does not cause granulomatous inflammation. Bowel and gastric cancer could present with similar symptoms, but would not cause granulomatous inflammation or perianal skin tags. IBD-NAN is not a recognized medical condition. Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and diagnostic testing, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn's disease.",a,a,TRUE,
729. a pt presents with hemoptysis 7d after tonsillectomy. what is the next step?,a. packing,b. oral antibiotics and discharge,c. admit and iv antibiotics,d. return to ot and explore,e. ice cream and cold fluids,,,,,,key: the key is c. admit and iv antibiotics. [secondary hemorrhage can occur from sloughing of tissue from surgical wound following infection].,"The correct answer is c. Admit the patient and start IV antibiotics. Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood, after a tonsillectomy could be a sign of secondary hemorrhage, which occurs when tissue sloughs off from the surgical wound following an infection. This is a serious condition that requires prompt treatment in a hospital setting. Choice a, packing, may help control bleeding in some cases, but it does not address the underlying infection. Choice b, oral antibiotics and discharge, is not appropriate because the patient needs close monitoring and IV antibiotics to treat a potentially life-threatening infection. Choice d, returning to ot and exploring, is not recommended because it could further damage the healing surgical wound and increase the risk of bleeding. Choice e, ice cream and cold fluids, is not a valid treatment option for hemoptysis and should not be considered.",c,c,TRUE,
"730. a 55yo man presents with htn. he complains of headache and visual disturbances. he also reports itching after a hot bath and burning sensation in finger and toes. his face is flushed red. pe: mild splenomegaly. inv: hgb=20g/dl, wbc=20, plt=500, epo normal. what is the likely dx?",a. myelofibrosis,b. polycythemia rubra vera,c. essential thrombocythemia,d. cml,e. cll,,,,,,"key: the key is b. polycythemia rubra vera. [raised hemglobin, raised cell counts and normal erythropoeitine along with symptoms of hyperviscosity like headache and associated hypertension are diagnostic of polycythemia rubra vera].","Based on the given clinical presentation and investigation results, the likely diagnosis for the 55-year-old man is polycythemia rubra vera. This is indicated by the raised hemoglobin and cell counts, along with normal erythropoietin levels, as well as symptoms of hyperviscosity such as headache and associated hypertension. The presence of mild splenomegaly and the patient's flushed red face are also consistent with this diagnosis. The reported itching after a hot bath and burning sensation in fingers and toes are also common symptoms of polycythemia rubra vera. Myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, CML, and CLL can all present with raised cell counts or related symptoms, but none of them fit all of the patient's presenting symptoms and laboratory results as closely as polycythemia rubra vera. Therefore, option B is the correct answer choice, while the other options are not as well-supported by the given information.",b,b,TRUE,
"731. an old man having t2dm with increased skin tanning, heart failure and having high ferritin (hemochromatosis) level is refusing tx. where is the first site of cancer?",a. testes,b. adrenal,c. liver,d. pancreas,,,,,,,key: the key is c. liver.,"The correct answer for this question is C. liver. The increased skin tanning and high ferritin level are both characteristic symptoms of liver cancer. Additionally, the fact that the patient has heart failure further supports the likelihood of liver cancer as the liver plays an important role in maintaining heart health. The other answer choices, including testes, adrenal, and pancreas, do not exhibit any direct relation to the given symptoms and would not be the first site of cancer for this patient. Therefore, the right answer is C. liver.",c,c,TRUE,
732. a 60yo dm lady presents with severe peri-anal pain and swelling. what’s the cause?,a. anal carcinoma,b. anal fissure,c. hemorrhoid,d. anal abscess,,,,,,,key: the key is d. anal abscess. [diabetes predisposes infection to occur easily].,"The correct answer is d, anal abscess. This is because the patient's symptoms of severe peri-anal pain and swelling are consistent with an abscess, which is a collection of pus in the tissue. Diabetes mellitus predisposes infection to occur easily in the body, leading to an increased risk of developing an anal abscess. Anal carcinoma, anal fissure, and hemorrhoid usually present with different symptoms or signs that are not consistent with the patient's condition. Therefore, the other options are incorrect.",d,d,TRUE,
"733. a woman is sad, fatigues and she is eating more and also has sleeping disturbance and hears the voice of her husband who died 3yrs ago. what is the dx?",a. ocd,b. psychotic depression,c. grieving,d. severe depression,,,,,,,key: the key is b. psychotic depression. [here features of atypical depression along with hallucination makes the likely diagnosis to be psychotic depression].,"The correct diagnosis for the woman in the question is psychotic depression (choice b). This conclusion is supported by the fact that the woman exhibits features of atypical depression along with hallucinations. Atypical depression is characterized by increased appetite and weight gain, oversleeping, fatigue, and hypersensitivity to rejection. In this case, the woman has all of these symptoms, along with hearing the voice of her deceased husband. This suggests that her depression has taken on a psychotic quality, leading to the diagnosis of psychotic depression. The other choices, such as OCD, grieving, or severe depression, are not supported by the symptoms exhibited by the woman. Overall, the most likely diagnosis is psychotic depression, which requires treatment with both antidepressant medication and antipsychotic medication.",b,b,TRUE,
734. a 40yo teetotaler woman is recovering from a hysterectomy 2days ago. at night she becomes agitated and complains of seeing animals and children walking around the ward. what is the most likely dx?,a. delirium tremens,b. toxic confusional state,c. hysteria,d. mania,e. drug induced personality disorder,,,,,,key: the key is b. toxic confusional state. [this is not delirium tremens as the womean is teetotaler].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 40-year-old teetotaler woman who is experiencing agitation and hallucinations after undergoing a hysterectomy two days ago is a toxic confusional state. This diagnosis is indicated by the key provided, which specifies that the key is ""b. toxic confusional state."" It is important to note that delirium tremens, which is characterized by withdrawal symptoms in alcoholics, is not a likely diagnosis for this woman as she is a teetotaler. Hysteria, mania, and drug-induced personality disorders are also unlikely as they do not fit the symptoms that the patient is presenting with. Therefore, the correct answer is toxic confusional state.",b,b,TRUE,
"735. a woman with a hx of drug abuse and increased alcohol intake, now comes for help and she is concerned about her problem. what is the most appropriate management option?",a. voluntary admission,b. psychiatry team,c. mental health team,d. psychiatry voluntary admission,,,,,,,key: the key is b. psychiatry team.,"The correct answer is B, psychiatry team. This option is the most appropriate because the woman has a history of drug abuse and increased alcohol intake, suggesting that she may be struggling with addiction or substance abuse. A psychiatry team can provide specialized care and support to help her manage her addiction and address any underlying mental health issues that may be contributing to her problem. Option A, voluntary admission, may not be the best choice if the woman is not yet ready or willing to receive treatment. Options C and D, mental health team and psychiatry voluntary admission, may not provide the specific expertise needed to manage addiction and substance abuse. Overall, the psychiatry team is the most appropriate choice given the woman's specific circumstances.",b,b,TRUE,
"736. a 28yo woman who is 32 wks pregnant in her 3rd pregnancy is diagnosed as a case of placental abruption. after all the effective measures, she is still bleeding. what is the underlying pathology?",a. clotting factor problem,b. clauser’s syndrome,c. platelet problem,d. succiturate lobe,e. villamentous insertion of placenta,,,,,,key: the key is a. clotting factor problem.,"The correct answer to this question is a. clotting factor problem. Placental abruption occurs when the placenta separates from the uterus before delivery, leading to heavy bleeding. While effective measures can be taken to control the bleeding, if the bleeding persists, it may indicate an underlying clotting factor problem. This can be due to various conditions such as von Willebrand's disease, hemophilia, or thrombocytopenia. Option b, clauser's syndrome, is not a recognized medical condition and is likely a misspelling of Clausen syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects bone development. Option c, platelet problem, may cause bleeding disorders but would not specifically lead to placental abruption. Option d, succenturiate lobe, is a rare abnormality in which there is an additional lobe of placenta that may be associated with complications but is not directly linked to placental abruption. Option e, villamentous insertion of placenta, is a condition where the placenta attaches to the uterine wall in an abnormal way, but this also does not cause placental abruption.",a,a,TRUE,
737. an old woman having decreased vision can’t see properly at night. she has changed her glasses quite a few times but with no effect. she has normal pupils and cornea. what is the most likely dx?,a. cataract,b. glaucoma,c. retinal detachment,d. iritis,e. gca,,,,,,key: the key is a. cataract. [glaucoma may have dilated oval pupil].,"Based on the information given, the most likely diagnosis for the old woman's decreased vision and difficulty seeing at night is cataract. Cataracts are a common condition in older adults and can cause cloudy or blurred vision. The fact that the woman has normal pupils and cornea also supports this diagnosis, as both glaucoma and iritis are associated with abnormal pupil size and shape, and retinal detachment often presents with other symptoms such as flashes of light or floaters. GCA, which stands for giant cell arteritis, is another condition that can cause visual disturbances but is less likely given the information provided. In summary, a diagnosis of cataract best fits the given symptoms and information.",a,a,TRUE,
"738. a 53yo man was admitted to the hospital for inv of hemoptysis. 3 days after admission he developed alternating state of consciousness, ataxic gait and some visual problems. what is the most appropriate management of this pt?",a. acamprosate,b. chlordiazepoxide,c. diazepam,d. high potent vitamins,e. disulfiram,,,,,,key: the key is d. high potent vitamins. [this is a case of wernicke’s encephalopathy (as hospital admission prevented him from consuming alcohol) and the treatment for this is high potent vitamins].,"This patient is likely suffering from Wernicke’s encephalopathy, as indicated by his symptoms of altered consciousness, ataxic gait, and visual problems in the context of hospital admission for hemoptysis. The most appropriate management for this condition is high-potency vitamins, specifically thiamine, to correct the underlying deficiency that is causing the neurological symptoms. Options a, b, c, and e are all medications used in the treatment of alcohol dependence, which is not the underlying cause of this patient’s condition and therefore not appropriate management. Disulfiram is a medication used to discourage alcohol consumption, which is also not relevant to this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is d, high potent vitamins.",d,d,TRUE,
739. a pt underwent hip surgery. later he presents with sob and chest pain. what is the dx?,a. pulmonary embolism,b. mi,c. tension pneumothorax,d. fat embolism,e. none,,,,,,key: the key is a. pulmonary embolism.,"The correct answer to this question is a) pulmonary embolism. This is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur after surgery due to blood clots that break free and travel to the lungs, resulting in shortness of breath and chest pain. The other choices, b) MI or heart attack, c) tension pneumothorax, d) fat embolism, and e) none of the above, are all incorrect because they do not match the symptoms presented. MI would have chest tightness or pressure, not just pain, and tension pneumothorax and fat embolism would likely present with other symptoms such as difficulty breathing or confusion. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare providers to recognize the signs of a pulmonary embolism and provide immediate treatment to prevent further complications.",a,a,TRUE,
740. a 25yo man presents with hx of breathlessness. a transthoracic echo reveals a patent foramen ovale. what diagnostic inv would you do for a patent foramen ovale?,a. transesophageal echo,b. bubble echo,c. transthoracic echo,d. ecg,,,,,,,key: the key is b. bubble echo. [bubble echo is actually extension of transoesophageal echo in that here additional bubbles are added during transoesophageal echo to get better visualization of foramen ovale].,"When investigating a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in a 25-year-old man presenting with breathlessness, the diagnostic investigation of choice would be a transesophageal echo (TEE). While a transthoracic echo (TTE) has already been performed and revealed the PFO, it may not provide adequate visualization for further evaluation and treatment planning. A bubble echo is actually an extension of TEE, in which additional bubbles are added to enhance visualization of the foramen ovale. However, TEE remains the gold standard for the detection and evaluation of PFOs. An ECG would not be an appropriate diagnostic investigation for this condition. Therefore, option b is the correct answer, and options a, c, and d are incorrect.",b,b,TRUE,
"741. a 25yo woman with a hx of several episodes of depression is brought to the ed after she was found with several empty bottles of her meds. she complains of coarse tremor, nausea and vomiting. which of the following drugs is likely to have caused her symptoms?",a. fluoxetine,b. amitryptilline,c. lithium,d. phenelzine,e. olanzapine,,,,,,"key: the key is c. lithium. [side effect of lithium is fine tremor (in therapeutic dose) but lithium toxicity or lithium poisoning causes coarse tremor. coarse tremor, nausea and vomiting are well known feature of lithium overdose].","The correct answer is C, lithium. The patient's symptoms of coarse tremor, nausea, and vomiting are well-known features of lithium overdose. While fluoxetine and amitriptyline are antidepressants, and phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, these drugs typically do not cause the symptoms described by the patient. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic, and while it can cause tremors as a side effect, coarse tremors are not typically associated with this medication. Therefore, lithium is the likeliest culprit for the patient's overdose symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
742. a 23yo man feels anxious and agitated when faced with stress. he has an interview in 3days and would like some help in relieving his symptoms. what is the most appropriate management?,a. ssri,b. cbt,c. propranolol,d. diazepam,,,,,,,key: the key is c. propranolol. [inappropriate anxiety during interview is performance phobia which is better helped by propranolol when help needed for short term like here as 3 days].,"The correct answer is c. Propranolol. This medication is typically used to help with performance anxiety or stage fright because it reduces physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and increased heart rate. It is effective for short-term use, such as in this case where the individual has an upcoming interview in three days. 
Option a, SSRIs, are not the best choice as they are typically used for treating long-term anxiety disorders. CBT (option b) can be helpful in managing anxiety in the long-term, but it is also not useful for immediate symptom relief. Diazepam (option d) is a benzodiazepine typically used for acute anxiety attacks. However, it can be addictive and lead to dependence, and is not the best option for performance anxiety in this case.",c,c,TRUE,
"743. an 8yo boy dx with asthma is on salbutamol and beclomethasone. however, he wakes up at night due to his symptoms. what is the next appropriate management?",a. laba,b. high dose steroid,c. aminophylline,d. oral prednisolone,e. sodium cromoglycate,,,,,,key: the key is a. laba. [patient is in step2 with poor control. so next step is to add laba and if still not controlled give high dose inhaled corticosteroids].,"Based on the patient's symptoms and current medication, the next appropriate management would be to add a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) to the current treatment regimen. If the patient is still not well-controlled, the next step would be to increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroids. Option B (high dose steroid) is incorrect as it does not address the need for a LABA, which is needed to manage the patient's symptoms at night. Option C (aminophylline) is not recommended as it is associated with a high risk of side effects and toxicity. Option D (oral prednisolone) is not appropriate for this patient as it is best reserved for acute exacerbations and not for long-term management. Option E (sodium cromoglycate) is not the best choice as it has a slower onset of action and may not be effective in managing the patient's nighttime symptoms. Therefore, the best management option for the patient is to add a LABA to the current medication regimen.",a,a,TRUE,
744. a woman presents with a hx of poisoning 10x with different substances. there are no obvious signs of depression or suicidal behavior. what is the best preventive step?,a. open access to ed,b. 24h help line,c. cbt,d. anti-depressants,e. insight into problem,,,,,,key: the key is e. insight into problem. [patient is not depressed and there is no suicidal behaviour. despite repeated poisoning may indicate she is facing some stress and so insight into her problem should be sought for].,"The correct answer is e, insight into the problem. This is because the repetition of poisoning, despite no signs of depression or suicidal behavior, suggests that the patient may be facing some form of stress or underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, seeking insight into the root of the problem can help prevent future poisonings. Options a and b may not address the underlying issue, while options c and d may not be appropriate if the patient is not experiencing depression.",e,e,TRUE,
745. a boy was rushed to the ed unconscious after he had taken methadone belonging to the sister. he was given naloxone and he regained consciousness. after a while he started getting drowsy again. what is responsible for his present drop in level of consciousness?,a. naloxone is absorbed faster than methadone,b. methadone is absorbed faster than naloxone,c. he has also taken another substance apart from methadone,d. the methadone had already caused some brain damage,e. naloxone is eliminated faster than methadone,,,,,,key: the key is e. naloxone is eliminated faster than methadone.,"The correct answer is E. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that immediately reverses the effects of opioids, including methadone. However, naloxone has a shorter half-life than methadone, meaning it is eliminated from the body faster. When the naloxone wears off, the methadone may continue to affect the boy, leading to his drop in level of consciousness. Choices A and B are inaccurate because absorption speed is not relevant to this situation. Choice C is a possibility, but there is no evidence to support it in the given information. Choice D is also unlikely because there is no indication of brain damage mentioned. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the boy's worsening condition is the shorter half-life of naloxone compared to methadone.",e,e,TRUE,
746. a 24yo male on remand in prison for murder is referred by the prison doctor. he is noted to be behaving oddly whilst in prison and complains of seeing things. he has a prv hx of iv drug abuse. on questioning he provides inappropriate but approximate answers to all questions stating that bill clinton is the prime minister of england. what is the prisoner suffering from?,a. capgras syndrome,b. cotard syndrome,c. ganser syndrome,d. ekbom syndrome,e. tourette’s syndrome,,,,,,"key: the key is c. ganser syndrome. [ganser syndrome is characterized by nonsensical or wrong answers to questions or doing things incorrectly often with visual pseudohallucinations and a decreased state of consciousness. it is also sometimes called prison psychosis, because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it may represent an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials].","The correct answer to this question is c. Ganser syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by providing nonsensical or approximate answers to questions, along with visual pseudohallucinations and a decreased state of consciousness. It is also known as ""prison psychosis"" because it occurs most frequently in inmates, possibly as an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials. The other choices are not correct: Capgras syndrome involves delusions that a loved one has been replaced by an impostor; Cotard syndrome involves delusions that one is dead or does not exist; Ekbom syndrome is a delusional belief in the presence of parasites; and Tourette's syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary vocalizations and movements.",c,c,TRUE,
"747. a 32yo lady has recently become more active, sleeps less and bought a house and 2 new cars. what is the most likely dx?",a. bipolar disorder,b. mania,c. hypomania,d. schizophrenia,,,,,,,"key: the key is c. hypomania. [individuals in a hypomanic state have a decreased need for sleep, are extremely outgoing and competitive, have a great deal of energy and are otherwise often fully functioning (unlike full mania where unlike fully functioning there is a. obvious difficulties at work or in social relationships and activities b. requires admission to hospital to protect the person or others, or c. the person is suffering psychosis)].","The correct answer is c. hypomania. This is because hypomania is characterized by a decreased need for sleep, an increase in activity levels, and impulsive behavior, such as making large purchases. However, individuals in a hypomanic state are otherwise fully functioning and do not experience the severe impairments that are present during full mania, such as difficulties at work or in social relationships and activities, or psychosis. This makes the choice of bipolar disorder, which encompasses both hypomania and mania, more appropriate than specifically selecting mania. Schizophrenia is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as it is not typically associated with the impulsive behavior and excessive energy seen in hypomania.",c,c,TRUE,
748. the body of a 65yo man who was treated for tb and bronchitis was seen at autopsy. his legs were swollen and his liver showed signs of a transudate fluid. what was the cause of the transudate?,a. liver cirrhosis,b. alcoholic liver disease,c. cardiac failure,d. budd-chiari syndrome,e. tb,,,,,,key: the key is c. cardiac failure.,"The cause of the transudate fluid found in the liver of a 65-year-old man who was treated for TB and bronchitis and had swollen legs is most likely cardiac failure, as indicated by the key ""c."" Cardiac failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, causing fluids to accumulate in the body's tissues. Liver cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and TB are all possible causes of liver damage but do not necessarily result in transudate fluid accumulation. Therefore, the correct answer is cardiac failure in this case.",c,c,TRUE,

[tanned skin (hyperpigmentation) and postural hypotension in a tired women points towards addison’s disease where hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is seen].","The correct answer is a) Na+=120mmol/l and K+=5.9mmol/l. The presentation of tanned skin and postural hypotension in a tired woman points towards Addison's disease, which is characterized by adrenal insufficiency. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands fail to produce enough cortisol and aldosterone hormones, leading to a decrease in sodium and an increase in potassium levels. This electrolyte pattern aligns with the given answer choice a). Answer choices b), c), d), and e) do not align with Addison's disease and the symptoms described.",a,a,TRUE,

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is characterized by a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may refuse to eat, eat only small quantities of food, or engage in excessive exercise to lose weight. The other choices (b. bulimia nervosa, c. OCD, d. depression, e. body dysmorphic disorder) do not fit the given symptoms of amenorrhea and BMI of 14, which are characteristic of anorexia nervosa. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this particular case is anorexia nervosa.",a,a,TRUE,

[antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. there may be an impoverished moral sense or conscience and a history of crime, legal problems, and impulsive and aggressive behavior].","The correct answer to this question is b) antisocial. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. This disorder is also commonly referred to as sociopathy or psychopathy. Individuals with this disorder may have a history of legal problems, impulsive and aggressive behavior, and a lack of remorse for their actions. In this scenario, the individual in question has several convictions and has been imprisoned multiple times, which is a clear indication of a history of legal problems and disregard for the rights of others. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not align with the symptoms exhibited by the individual. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by instability in mood, behavior, and self-image, while schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by odd behavior, beliefs, and difficulty forming relationships. Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, while the answer choice criminal is not a valid personality disorder.",b,b,TRUE,
752. a 17yo lady presents with a worm in her ear. she is very agitated and anxious. what is the next step?,a. remove under ga,b. suction,c. alcohol drops,d. forceps,,,,,,,key: the key is c. alcohol drops. [it is a living object. so it should be killed first and so alcohol drop is the correct option].,"The correct answer is c) alcohol drops. While forceps or suction may seem like more direct options for removing the worm, they come with a higher risk of injury to the ear canal and potential harm to the worm itself. Using alcohol drops helps to anesthetize and kill the worm, making it easier to remove safely. Putting the worm to sleep with alcohol is the safest and most efficient option in this case, especially given the patient's anxiety and agitation. Choosing option a) to remove the worm under general anesthesia may also be considered, but generally should be reserved for more complicated or risky procedures.",c,c,TRUE,
753. a 20yo male smoker is noted to have intense rubor of the feet and absent foot pulse. exam: amputated right 2nd toe. what is the most probable dx?,a. intermittent claudication,b. cardiovascular syphilis,c. buerger’s disease,d. embolism,e. acute limb ischemia,,,,,,"key: the key is c. buerger’s disease. [ the traditional diagnosis of buerger's disease is based on 5 criteria (smoking history, onset before the age of 50 years, infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease, either upper limb involvement or phlebitis migrans, and absence of atherosclerotic risk factors other than smoking). as there is no specific diagnostic test and an absence of positive serologic markers, confident clinical diagnosis should be made only when all these 5 criteria have been fulfilled].","The correct answer is c, Buerger's disease. This is due to the patient being a young smoker with infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease, absent foot pulse, and intense rubor of the feet, which are all criteria for Buerger's disease. The fact that the patient also has an amputated right 2nd toe further points towards the diagnosis of Buerger's disease. Intermittent claudication and cardiovascular syphilis are unlikely due to the specific presentation and history of the patient. Embolism and acute limb ischemia are also less likely as they do not fully explain the chronic obstructive arterial disease present in this patient.",c,c,TRUE,

[in young it is unlikely to get oesophageal varices rather than the bleeding is from probable gastric erosion and endoscopy should be done (diagnostic and therapeutic- like sclerotherapy].,"The correct answer is d. Endoscopy. This young lady is presenting with symptoms of bleeding from the digestive tract, most likely caused by gastric erosion due to excessive alcohol consumption. While a clotting screen or ultrasound may be useful in some cases, endoscopy is the best choice for both diagnosis and treatment. With endoscopy, the site of bleeding can be directly visualized and treated with sclerotherapy if needed. CT or omeprazole will not be useful in this situation. Therefore, the next best management for this patient would be to perform an endoscopy.",d,d,TRUE,

Additionally, the prolonged bleeding time is a common finding in ITP. The other options (TTP, von Willebrand's disease, hemophilia A, and hemophilia B) can be ruled out as they do not fit with the clinical presentation or laboratory results. TTP would have a more severe drop in platelet count, while von Willebrand's disease, hemophilia A, and B would have abnormalities in the clotting factors.

These drugs are known to be established causes of postural hypotension, so it is essential to monitor her blood pressure over 24 hours to ensure that her blood pressure is not dropping below safe levels. Other choices such as 24h ECG, ECG, echo, and CT head are not relevant in this situation and will not provide useful information for the patient's current symptoms. Therefore, 24h BP monitoring is required to evaluate the potential cause of the patient's falls, pale appearance, and clumsiness.",b,b,TRUE,

758. a 2yo child aspirated a foreign object which was removed at the hosp. the parents are now asking how to remove it if that ever happens at home. what do you advise?,a. hemlich maneuver,b. bring to the hospital,c. turn the child on his back and give thumps,d. cpr,e. remove manually by fingers,,,,,,key: the key is c. turn the child on his back and give thumps.,"If a 2-year-old child aspirates a foreign object at home, the first thing to do is to stay calm and assess the situation. If the child is coughing forcefully, encourage them to continue coughing to try to expel the object. If the child is not able to cough, cry or speak, or is making high-pitched noises while inhaling, they may be choking and need immediate assistance. According to the Red Cross, you can try to remove the foreign object by taking the child on your lap on their stomach, with their head lower than their body. Hit between the shoulder blades firmly, but carefully, five times. If the hits do not remove the foreign object from the throat, call emergency services. Put the phone on speaker and continue helping. Continue with abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)1. It s important to note that only a trained and qualified individual should attempt these techniques. If you are unsure of what to do or if the child is not breathing, call emergency services immediately and follow their instructions. Bringing the child to the hospital for professional medical assistance is always a safe optio",c,c,TRUE,
759. a 28yo pregnant lady presents with severe lower abdominal pain with excessive per vaginal bleeding at 34wks gestation. what should be the initial inv of choice?,a. coagulation profile,b. us abdomen,c. ct pelvis,d. d-dimer,e. kleiuber test,,,,,,key: the key is b. us abdomen. [likely case of abruption placenta (as excessive bleeding probably revealed type) for which initial investigation of choice is us abdomen. other features that will favour abruptio is hard uterus and evidence of fetal distress. it will be difficult to feel the fetal parts].,"The correct answer to this question is b. ultrasound (US) of the abdomen. This is because the patient presented with severe lower abdominal pain and excessive per vaginal bleeding, which are both indicative of a likely case of abruption placenta. Abruption placenta occurs when the placenta separates from the uterine wall before the baby is born, which can cause heavy bleeding and is a medical emergency. US abdomen is the initial investigation of choice because it can provide crucial information on the status of the fetus and the extent of the bleeding. Other features that may suggest a diagnosis of abruption placenta include a hard uterus and evidence of fetal distress. Tests such as coagulation profile, CT pelvis, d-dimer, or Kleiuber test are not appropriate initial investigations for this presentation and may not provide the necessary information needed to make a diagnosis. Therefore, US abdomen is the best initial investigation to assess and manage this patient's condition.",b,b,TRUE,

[patient has features of severe dehydration and should be resuscitated first and for resuscitation fluid of choice is 0.9% ns].,"The correct answer is a. 0.9%ns. This is because the patient exhibits features of severe dehydration and requires resuscitation. The fluid of choice for resuscitation is 0.9% normal saline (ns). The other choices, including 0.9%ns + 5% dextrose, 0.45%ns + 5% dextrose, and 0.45%ns, are not appropriate for resuscitation of severe dehydration. It is important to note that the patient's condition should be closely monitored and adjusted accordingly. However, the immediate priority is to resuscitate the patient with 0.9%ns.",a,a,TRUE,
761. a lady with depression has a bag full of meds. she now presents with coarse tremors. which drug caused her symptoms?,a. lithium,b. thyroxine,c. amitriptyline,d. sodium valproate,e. tetrabenazine,,,,,,key: the key is a. lithium. it is a wrong key! right key is d. sodium valproate. [side effect of lithium in therapeutic range is fine tremor. sodium valproate (a well known mood stabilizer) can cause coarse tremor in therapeutic range].,"The correct answer to the question is d. sodium valproate. The lady's presentation with coarse tremors suggests that she is experiencing a side effect of the medication, and sodium valproate is a known mood stabilizer that can cause this type of tremor in the therapeutic range. Option a is incorrect as fine tremor is a side effect of lithium, but it does not match the presentation described. Option b, thyroxine, is a hormone replacement therapy and does not typically cause tremors. Option c, amitriptyline, is a tricyclic antidepressant that may cause tremors in higher doses but is rarely used for depression. Lastly, option e, tetrabenazine, is used to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease, but it is a less commonly prescribed medication and would not be expected to be part of the lady's medication regimen. Therefore, the most likely medication causing the lady's tremors would be sodium valproate.",d,d,TRUE,

[in hemochromatosis distribution pattern of iron in liver biopsy by pearl’s stain is more prominent iron granules in periportal hepatocyte and relative sparing of kupffer cells and decreased intensity near the central vein. by contrast iron overload in hemosiderosis causes to accumulation of iron granules predominantly in kupffer cells and more in central area rather than peripheral hepatocyte. in given case there are large amount of iron pigment  in hepatocyte which is diagnostic of hemochromatosis].,"The correct answer to the question is c. hemochromatosis. This is because the distribution pattern of iron in the liver biopsy, as identified by Pearl's stain, shows iron granules in periportal hepatocytes and relative sparing of Kupffer cells, with decreased intensity near the central vein. This is in contrast to hemosiderosis, where iron granules accumulate predominantly in Kupffer cells, particularly in the central area rather than peripheral hepatocyte. In the given case, the large amount of iron pigment identified in hepatocytes is diagnostic of hemochromatosis. The other options, including alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemangioma, Wilson's disease, and hemosiderosis, do not fit this pattern and can therefore be ruled out.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because acute compartment syndrome can occur after a traumatic injury such as a car crash, and the trauma causes a severe high pressure in the compartment which results in insufficient blood supply to muscles and nerves. If left untreated, the lack of blood supply leads to permanent muscle and nerve damage and can result in the loss of function of the limb. Arterial rupture (b), arterial embolus (c), and DVT (d) can present with similar symptoms, but given the mechanism of injury in this case and the specific findings on physical examination, compartment syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Fibular fx (e) may be suspected in cases of trauma but would not cause the specific findings described in this patient's presentation.

The patient's history of improving symptoms prior to attending a picnic followed by sudden onset of noisy breathing after choking on something, along with the presence of elevated respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation, suggest a partial obstruction in the airway. Anaphylaxis (A) is unlikely since there is no history of exposure to allergens and the patient's symptoms developed over a longer period of time. Croup (B) and epiglottitis (D) are also less likely since the patient's noisy breathing does not present as the typical ""barking"" cough associated with croup, and epiglottitis is a rare occurrence with distinctive symptoms such as high fever, drooling, and difficulty swallowing. Therefore, foreign body aspiration is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's clinical presentation and history.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because doxycycline can cause gastrointestinal irritation and taking it after a meal can help prevent this. Answer B - take it before meals - is incorrect because taking it before a meal can actually worsen the gastrointestinal symptoms. Answer C - stop the drug - is an extreme option and not necessary if the symptoms can be managed. Answer D - take antiacids - may provide relief for indigestion but may not resolve the other symptoms. Answer E - take antiemetic - may provide relief for vomiting but may not resolve the other symptoms. Therefore, the best advice would be to take doxycycline after meals to help alleviate the gastrointestinal symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[the question does not want to know the features of pulmonary oedema rather it is clearly mentioned “which investigation would you do to find out the underlying cause”. as in this patient sudden papillary muscle rupture or vsd may be the likely cause (ventricular aneurism may take a more slower course) so echo seems to be more logical approach].,"In this scenario, the most appropriate investigation to find out the underlying cause of the patient's sudden onset of dyspnea is an echo, option b. The patient has a history of anterior myocardial infarction three weeks ago, and it is possible that sudden papillary muscle rupture or VSD could be the cause of his current condition. While a CXR, option a, could provide information on any possible pulmonary edema, it is not the best investigation to determine the underlying cause. D-dimer, option c, and radionuclide lung scan, option d, are not appropriate tests in this situation. Troponin, option e, can provide information on myocardial injury but would not be sufficient to establish the cause of the sudden dyspnea. Therefore, an echo seems to be the most logical approach, as it can help identify any structural changes in the heart that may be causing the patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[as the patient has persecutory delusion he is likely suffering from psychosis for which neuropsychoanalysis is the logical approach].,"The correct answer for this question is b. Neuropsychoanalysis. The man who is homeless, wandering and muttering about people coming after him is exhibiting symptoms of psychosis. As alcohol has been tested to be negative, it can be concluded that this is due to a mental health issue. A neuropsychoanalytic approach will allow the patient to explore the root cause of their paranoia and hallucinations. The other answer choices, such as thiamine, mini mental state, CT head, and MRI head, are not appropriate in this scenario as they do not address the need for a psychiatric evaluation to assess the patient's mental health condition. Overall, the best course of action is to perform a thorough neuropsychoanalytic evaluation to help identify the causes of the patient's psychosis and enable effective treatment.",b,b,TRUE,

The likely cause for these symptoms is an acoustic neuroma, which can be appropriately investigated with an MRI of the internal acoustic meatus. CT of the internal auditory meatus, nuclear imaging of the brain, radio isotope scan, and XR skull are not as definitive as an MRI of the internal auditory meatus for this particular patient presentation. Therefore, an MRI of the internal auditory meatus is the most appropriate and reliable diagnostic test for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and typically presents with a pearly white umbilicated ulcer with rolled or inverted edges and a central depression. It is also worth noting that any ulcer located above the neck is always considered as basal cell carcinoma until proven otherwise. Squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma may present with similar characteristics, but they usually have different clinical features, such as a more irregular shape, irregular pigmentation, or bleed easily. Lymph nodes typically appear as a nodule and present in multiple locations, and kaposi's sarcoma and molluscum contagiosum lack the features described in the question. Therefore, based on the characteristics described, basal cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

This is due to the patient experiencing rotational vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, which are all symptoms commonly associated with vestibular neuronitis. Additionally, the patient has a history of similar episodes following events of runny nose, cold, cough, and fever, which are recognized triggers for vestibular neuronitis. The other choices, including acoustic neuroma, Meniere’s disease, labyrinthitis, and BPPV, are unlikely diagnoses for this patient as they commonly present with other symptoms such as sensory neural hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or a sudden onset of symptoms.",e,e,TRUE,
771. a 65yo man with cancer of middle 1/3 of the esophagus presents with dysphagia. what is the most immediate management?,a. chemotherapy,b. radiotherapy,c. stenting,d. gastrostomy,e. tpn,,,,,,key: the key is c. stenting.,"The correct answer is c. Stenting. This is the most immediate management option for a 65-year-old man with cancer of the middle 1/3 of the esophagus who presents with dysphagia. Stenting involves the placement of a stent, which is a small mesh or metal tube, to keep the esophagus open and allow food to pass through. This helps to relieve the symptoms of dysphagia and improve the patient's quality of life. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be used as part of the treatment plan for esophageal cancer, but they are not the most immediate management options for dysphagia. Gastrostomy and TPN are also not immediate management options for dysphagia associated with esophageal cancer. Therefore, the best immediate management option in this case is c. Stenting.",c,c,TRUE,
772. a 1yo child is brought to ed. he woke up in the middle of the night crying severely. what initial measure should be taken for this child?,a. refer to surgeon,b. discharge with advice,c. analgesia,d. antibiotic,,,,,,,key: the key is c. analgesia.,"The correct answer to this question is c, which is analgesia. The child woke up crying severely in the middle of the night and therefore is likely experiencing pain, which needs to be addressed immediately. Referring the child to a surgeon would be premature, whereas discharging the child with advice without addressing the pain would not be appropriate. Antibiotics would not be indicated unless an infection is suspected, which is not evident in this case. Thus, the initial measure that should be taken is to provide analgesia, which can help alleviate the child's pain and discomfort.",c,c,TRUE,

[likely diagnosis is scaphoid fracture where x-ray may not show the fracture right away. in such case put her hand in a below elbow cast and repeat x-ray in a week or two  to see if the fracture become visible. usually it becomes visible as a healing fracture line].,"In a 30-year-old woman who has sustained an injury to her hand while playing volleyball, the most appropriate next management would be to repeat the X-ray, with the key being C. Despite the X-ray being normal, there is tenderness present under the root of the thumb, indicating a possible scaphoid fracture, which can be difficult to detect on initial imaging. Therefore, putting her hand in a below elbow cast and repeating X-ray in a week or two may be necessary for the diagnosis since a healing fracture line usually becomes visible on repeat imaging. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect as they do not address the possibility of a scaphoid fracture and may not provide adequate treatment for the injury.",c,c,TRUE,
774. a 33yo female presents with sudden severe colicky abdominal pain in her rif. a mobile mass is felt on examination. what is the most likely dx?,a. pid,b. appendicitis,c. ovarian torsion,d. constipation,,,,,,,key: the key is c. ovarian torsion.,"The most likely diagnosis for a 33-year-old female presenting with sudden severe colicky abdominal pain in her right iliac fossa and a mobile mass on examination is ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion is a medical emergency that occurs when an ovary twists around its own blood vessels, which can cause severe pain and compromise blood flow to the ovary. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a possible diagnosis, but it typically presents with bilateral lower abdominal pain and tenderness, as well as discharge, fever, and cervical motion tenderness. Appendicitis can also cause right lower quadrant abdominal pain, but it often presents with fever and progressive, localized pain. Constipation can cause abdominal discomfort and bloating, but it is unlikely to cause a palpable mass. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the presented symptoms is ovarian torsion. Immediate emergency medical intervention is necessary to prevent permanent damage to the affected ovary.",c,c,TRUE,

[ecg change of prolonged qrs complex and tented t wave are suggestive of hyperkalaemia which is further supported by k+ level of 6.2 mmol/l. so to protect the heart from arrhythmia calcium gluconate should be given].,"A middle-aged male who recently suffered an MI and is presenting with prolonged QRS complex and tented T wave on ECG along with elevated K+ levels of 6.2 mmol/L indicative of hyperkalemia should be given calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate is the most appropriate management in this scenario as it protects the heart from arrhythmia which is a potential risk in hyperkalemia. The other answer options are incorrect because calcium resonium is used for hyperkalemia with normal or elevated sodium levels, calcium with vit D supplement is used for calcium-deficient states, and vitamin D is primarily used to increase the absorption of calcium from the small intestine. Hence, calcium gluconate is the most appropriate treatment in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

[acei is renoprotective and prevents progress in albuminuria].,"The correct answer for the best drug to add to the regimen of a 68-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and hypertension with a cholesterol level of 3.4mmol/L and microalbuminuria is a) ACE inhibitor (ACEi). ACEi is renoprotective and prevents the progression of albuminuria, which is an early sign of kidney damage. ACEi also reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Statin can help reduce cholesterol levels, but it is not specifically indicated for the management of microalbuminuria or hypertension. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is used to lower blood pressure, but it does not have the renal protective effects of ACEi. Biguanides such as metformin are used to manage diabetes, but they do not have any specific actions on blood pressure or albuminuria. Therefore, adding ACEi is the most appropriate choice in this case due to its renal-protective and cardiovascular benefits.",a,a,TRUE,

[breathlessness and stridor in a child playing with toy is most likely due to aspiration of foreign body (toy or part of toy) for which laryngoscopy should be done].,"The correct answer to the question is a. Laryngoscopy. When a child playing with toys suddenly experiences breathlessness and stridor, it is most likely due to the aspiration of a foreign body such as a toy or part of a toy. Therefore, an immediate and accurate diagnosis is crucial to avoid further complications. Laryngoscopy is the most suitable investigation in this case as it can provide a direct visualization of the larynx and help with the removal of the foreign body. CXR, peak flow meter, and ABG are not the appropriate investigations for this condition as they do not provide direct visualization. Therefore, the correct and most appropriate investigation would be laryngoscopy.",a,a,TRUE,

This technique is recommended by the American Heart Association for infants and young children. Option A (5 compressions to 1 breath) is not recommended for children under the age of 8, while option B (5 compressions to 2 breaths) is outdated and no longer recommended. Option D (15 compressions to 2 breaths without nose pinched) is also not recommended as it can lead to air escaping through the nose and not into the lungs. Option E appears to have a typo, as it does not make sense to perform 30 breaths instead of compressions. It is essential to use the correct resuscitation technique when dealing with pediatric emergencies, as improper techniques can lead to inadequate resuscitation and potential harm to the child.",c,c,TRUE,

[increased volume of blood streaked sputum and clubbing points towards bronchiectasis].,"The most likely cause of the increased volume of sputum with specks of blood and clubbing in a 56-year-old man with a history of deep vein thrombosis is bronchiectasis. Clubbing is a common feature of bronchiectasis and the presence of blood in the sputum suggest bronchial damage or inflammation. Pulmonary thrombosis and pulmonary tuberculosis may also present with cough, but are less likely in this case due to the absence of other relevant symptoms. Bronchial carcinoma is a possibility; however, the absence of other suggestive symptoms and the presence of clubbing point towards bronchiectasis as the more likely diagnosis. Therefore, the key to this question is c. bronchiectasis.",c,c,TRUE,

The history of fever and prior TB infection are more suggestive of bronchiectasis. In bronchiectasis, spirometry can be variable and show either a restrictive, obstructive, or normal pattern. Additionally, the pre-bronchodilation test showed a lower value (2/3.5) compared to the post-bronchodilation test (3/3.7), which is not typically seen in COPD or pneumonia. Asthma can also present with shortness of breath, but usually, there is a history of wheezing, which is absent in this patient.

[both lymphangioma and brancheal cyst are lateral neck mass. 90% of lymphangioma occur in children less than 2 yrs. brancheal cyst usually does not transilluminate whereas lymphangioma usually transilluminate brilliantly].,"Based on the description provided, the most likely diagnosis is a lymphangioma (answer option a). Lymphangiomas are lateral neck masses that commonly occur in children under two years old and are brilliantly transilluminant. Branchial cysts, on the other hand, typically do not transilluminate and are often located posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Thyroglossal cysts are midline neck masses that move with swallowing and may be accompanied by pain. Ranulas are typically cystic masses located in the floor of the mouth. Thyroid swellings would be located in the anterior neck and may be associated with thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, given the specific location, transillumination and age of the patient, lymphangioma is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

Treatment with trimethoprim, option D, is most appropriate for this patient. Imipramine, option A, is an antidepressant and not indicated for the treatment of UTIs. Adjusting diuretics, option B, may be necessary for the management of hypertension but is not effective for the treatment of UTIs. Vaginal estrogen, option C, is used in postmenopausal women experiencing vaginal atrophy, but is not indicated for treatment of UTIs. Therefore, trimethoprim is the optimal choice for treating the UTI in this patient.",d,d,TRUE,

[as tympanic membrane is normal so this transient inflammation of pinna from injury during rugby match is self limiting which needs no further intervention].,"The correct answer to this question is e, no further intervention is needed. This is because the exam findings suggest that the injury only affected the pinna and the tympanic membrane, which is a thin layer of tissue that separates the outer and middle ear, appeared normal. The redness and tenderness of the pinna are likely due to transient inflammation caused by the injury, which is self-limiting and does not require any medical treatment. Therefore, prescribing topical gentamicin or oral/IV flucloxacillin, which are antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections, is unnecessary and potentially harmful in this case. Referring the boy to an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist would also be unnecessary since there is no indication of any serious ear complications. In summary, the most appropriate step in this case is to reassure the boy that his symptoms will likely improve with time and recommend pain relief measures as needed.",e,e,TRUE,
784. a 2yo girl prv well presents with a hx of vomiting and diarrhea for 4hrs. what is the most suitable indication for iv fluid administration?,a. capillary refill time >4s,b. hr >90bpm,c. increased rr,d. stool >10x/d,e. weight of child = 10kgs,,,,,,key: the key is a. capillary refill time >4s. [capillary refill time >4s is sign of severe dehydration indicating need for iv fluid administration. features of severe dehydration: i) abnormally sleepy or lethargic ii) sunken eyes iii) drinking poorly or not at all iv) reduced skin turgr > 2 seconds v) dry tongue and mucous membrane vi) absent tears vii) oliguria viii) hypotension ix) tachycardia x) prolonged capillary refill time xi) depressed anterior frontanelle].,"The correct answer is (a) capillary refill time >4s. This is because capillary refill time is a key indicator of severe dehydration, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Other features of severe dehydration are also listed, including reduced skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, oliguria, hypotension, tachycardia, and depressed anterior fontanelle. Choices (b), (c), (d), and (e) are not the most suitable indications for IV fluid administration because they focus on other symptoms that may also be present in dehydration but are not as critical as prolonged capillary refill time. Therefore, the correct answer is (a) capillary refill time >4s, which indicates severe dehydration and the need for urgent IV fluid administration to prevent further complications.",a,a,TRUE,
785. a 44yo woman with breast cancer had an extensive removal and ln clearance. she needs an adjunctive tx. her mother had cancer when she was 65. which of the following factors will be against the tx?,a. fam hx,b. tumor grading,c. ln involvement,d. her age,,,,,,,key: the key is d. her age. probably wrong key. correct key should be b. tumour grading. [what ever the age oestrogen receptor positive patient will take tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy. but tumour grading in some instance may influence the need of adjuvant therapy. though the given key is d it is probably a wrong key and correct key should be b. tumour grading].,"The correct answer for this question is b. Tumour grading. Tumour grading can influence the need for adjuvant therapy in some instances. Although estrogen receptor is positive and the patient will most likely take tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy regardless of age, tumour grading can help determine if additional therapy is necessary. The given key, d. her age, is most likely incorrect as age alone does not determine the need for adjuvant therapy. Factors like family history (a), lymph node involvement (c), and tumour size (not given as an option) can also impact the decision for adjuvant therapy. Therefore, the correct key is b. tumour grading.",b,b,TRUE,
786. a 45yo man presents with hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear. exam: weber test lateralizes to the left. audiometry: ac > bc in both ears. what is the next best inv?,a. ct,b. mri brain,c. angiogram,d. otoscopy,,,,,,,key: the key is b. mri brain. [ac>bc indicate rinne positive; i.e. the deafness is not conductive. again hearing loss is on right side. weber lateralized to left. we know weber lateralized to same side if conductive deafness and to opposite if there is sensoryneural deafness. so it is now obvious that the deafness of right ear is sensoryneural deafness for which mri brain is the next best investigation].,"The correct answer is b, MRI brain. The results of the Weber test show that the hearing loss is on the right side, and the finding that AC is greater than BC in both ears indicates that the deafness is not conductive. Since the patient has sensoryneural deafness, the next best investigation would be an MRI of the brain to assess if there are any structural causes or abnormalities affecting the auditory pathways. The other choices, CT and angiogram, are not appropriate in this case as they do not provide enough detail to evaluate the auditory pathways, and otoscopy would not provide any information about the cause of the deafness.",b,b,TRUE,
"787. a 74yo lady called an ambulance for an acute chest pain. she has a hx of dm and htn, and is a heavy smoker. paramedics mentioned that she was overweight and recently immobile because of a hip pain. she collapsed and died in the ambulance. what is the most likely cause of death?",a. pulmonary embolism,b. mi,c. stroke,d. cardiac arrhythmia,e. cardiac failure,,,,,,key: the key is a. pulmonary embolism. this is wrong key! correct key is mi.,"The correct answer to this question is b. MI or myocardial infarction. The patient's medical history of DM, HTN, and heavy smoking puts her at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Her recent immobility due to hip pain and being overweight also adds to this risk. Acute chest pain is a common symptom of MI, and the fact that the patient collapsed and died in the ambulance suggests that she suffered a sudden cardiac event. Pulmonary embolism, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiac failure are all potential causes of sudden death, but in this case, the patient's risk factors and presenting symptoms point towards MI as the most likely cause.",b,b,TRUE,
788. a 77yo woman suffered diarrhea 4d ago. what would be her blood gas result?,"a. ph =7.2, paco2 =8","b. ph =7.4, paco2 =1.5","c. ph =7.4, paco2 =2.6","d. ph =7.4, paco2 =2.8",,,,,,,"key: the key is b. ph = 7.4, paco2 = 1.5 [diarrhoea causes metabolic acidosis and in response there occurs respiratory compensation [hyperventilation] leading to respiratory alkalosis and low paco2 (due to co2 washout)].","The correct answer for the blood gas result of a 77-year-old woman who suffered from diarrhea 4 days ago would be b) ph = 7.4, paco2 = 1.5. Diarrhea causes metabolic acidosis, which triggers respiratory compensation in the form of hyperventilation leading to respiratory alkalosis and low paco2 due to the elimination of CO2. Option a) with a pH of 7.2 suggests severe metabolic acidosis, which is unlikely to occur as a result of diarrhea. Options c) and d) both have normal paco2 levels, which would not be expected in respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.",b,b,TRUE,
"789. a man presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, pulse=120bpm, bp=90/60mmhg and a rigid abdomen. his chest is clear. what is the immediate management?",a. call radiology,b. admit to medical ward,c. urgent admission to itu (intensive therapy unit),,,,,,,,key: the key is c. urgent admission to itu.,"The correct answer to this question is c. urgent admission to itu. This is because the patient is showing signs of potential circulatory collapse, therefore, requires immediate, advanced monitoring and treatment in an intensive therapy unit. Admitting the patient to a medical ward or calling radiology would be inappropriate in this situation as it fails to address the severity of the symptoms and the patient's immediate needs. Choosing option c implies an understanding of the patient's critical state and the urgency of treating potential life-threatening conditions. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize the patient's immediate needs to prevent further complications.",c,c,TRUE,
790. a 60yo man presents with weight loss and hgb=6. hx reveals that he has abdominal pain and diarrhea for the past 6m. what is the most appropriate inv?,a. barium enema,b. colonoscopy,c. sigmoidoscopy,,,,,,,,key: the key is b. colonoscopy. [likely diagnosis is ibd. so colonoscopy should be done].,"The correct answer to this question is b. colonoscopy. This is because the patient's presentation of weight loss, low hemoglobin levels, and symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea for 6 months are indicative of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Therefore, a colonoscopy is necessary to visualize the colon and rectum to make an accurate diagnosis and assess the extent and severity of the condition. Barium enema is not appropriate because it only provides a static image of the colon and may miss subtle changes and lesions. Sigmoidoscopy is not recommended as it only visualizes the lower part of the colon and may miss significant lesions in the upper parts. Therefore, the most appropriate investigation for this patient is a colonoscopy to diagnose IBD and determine the extent and severity of the disease.",b,b,TRUE,
791. a 35yo primigravida post c-section complains of inability to void. she denies dysuria but complains of fullness. she was treated with an epidural for analgesia. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. msu,b. us abdomen,c. us kub,d. serum calcium,,,,,,,key: the key is b. us abdomen. [c. us kub. is also correct! this is a case of pour (post operative urinary retention). we should do us to know the urinary volume (urine volume in bladder). if <400ml we shall observe. when volume is >600ml we should do catheterization].,"The single most appropriate investigation for a 35-year-old primigravida who is post c-section and complains of inability to void, but denies dysuria and complains of fullness, is option C - US KUB. This is because the symptoms suggest post-operative urinary retention, which is a common complication after c-section and can be assessed by measuring the urine volume in the bladder through US KUB. Option A, MSU, is incorrect because there are no indications of a UTI. Option B, US abdomen, is partially correct as it may identify if there are any post-operative complications but does not specifically address the patient's urinary symptoms. Lastly, option D, serum calcium, is completely irrelevant to the patient's symptoms and should not be considered. If the urine volume in the bladder is found to be <400ml, observation may be recommended, but if the volume is >600ml, catheterization should be performed.",c,c,TRUE,
792. a female pt with htn and serum k+=2.7mmol/l. which hormone would you be looking for?,a. aldosterone,b. cortisol,c. thyrotoxin,d. renin,e. testosterone,,,,,,key: the key is a. aldosterone. [hpt and hypokalemia is seen in hyperaldosteronism. so we should look for aldosterone].,"In a female patient with hypertension and serum potassium levels of 2.7 mmol/L, the hormone that should be examined is aldosterone. This is because hypokalemia and hypertension are commonly associated with hyperaldosteronism. Renin is another hormone that is involved in regulating blood pressure, but it is not directly associated with hypokalemia. Cortisol and testosterone are hormones that are not related to hypertension or potassium levels. Thyroxine or T4 is also not associated with hypokalemia and hypertension. Therefore, the most likely hormone to be considered in this case is aldosterone.",a,a,TRUE,
"793. a 25yo male with a hx of frequent binge drinking presents 4h after having had a take away meal following a nights heavy drinking. he complains of nausea and has vomited on several occasions. after the last vomiting episode, he vomited approximately a cupful of blood. on admission, he smells of alcohol, pulse=100bpm, bp=140/80mmhg. he has some tenderness in the epigastrium. what is your dx?",a. gastric carcinoma,b. mallory-weiss tear,c. esophageal carcinoma,d. esophageal varices,e. peptic ulceration,,,,,,key: the key is mallory-weiss tear. [repeated retching and vomiting is a recognized cause of mallory-weiss tear which is supported here by vomiting a cupful of blood].,"Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the correct diagnosis is likely to be Mallory-Weiss tear. The fact that the patient has a history of frequent binge drinking and smells of alcohol suggests that he may have damaged his stomach lining by repeated retching and vomiting, which can cause a tear in the junction between the esophagus and stomach known as Mallory-Weiss tear. The fact that the patient vomited a cupful of blood after the last episode of vomiting supports this diagnosis. Other possible diagnoses such as gastric carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, esophageal varices, and peptic ulceration are less likely given the patient's age and history. However, further investigations such as endoscopy may be required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.",b,b,TRUE,
"794. a young boy presented with bilateral periorbital edema, ankle swelling and increase in body weight. what is the most likely dx?",a. chronic heart failure,b. nephrotic syndrome,c. renal failure,d. acute heart failure,e. glomerulonephritis,,,,,,key: the key is b. nephrotic syndrome.,"The correct answer is b. nephrotic syndrome. This condition is characterized by the excessive loss of protein through urine due to damage or inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys. This results in fluid accumulation in the body, causing symptoms like bilateral periorbital edema, ankle swelling, and weight gain. The other options are less likely because chronic heart failure typically presents with shortness of breath and fatigue, acute heart failure presents with sudden onset of symptoms, renal failure presents with decreased urine output and high levels of waste materials in the blood, and glomerulonephritis presents with blood in the urine and high blood pressure. Therefore, based on the presented symptoms and context, the most likely diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome.",b,b,TRUE,

[patient has hypoxemia and hypercapnea (type2 respiratory failure). hence he should be put on 24% oxygen. 100% oxygen will abolish hypoxic drive and worsen hypercapnea].,"The appropriate management for the 53-year-old man with a history of COPD who is presenting with breathlessness and purulent sputum, and has an oxygen saturation level of 85% on air, is option A, 24% oxygen. The ABG results show hypoxemia and hypercapnea, which is indicative of type 2 respiratory failure. It is recommended to avoid administering 100% oxygen as it can worsen the hypercapnea by abolishing the hypoxic drive. Mechanical ventilation would be necessary if the patient were in respiratory distress or failure, but it is not indicated in this case, as the patient is not described as such. Nebulized salbutamol may be helpful in relieving bronchoconstriction, but it is not the primary intervention for managing hypoxemia and hypercapnea in this patient. Therefore, option A, 24% oxygen, is the most appropriate management for his condition.",a,a,TRUE,
796. a 34yo man was involved in a rta and whilst in the ambulance his gcs deteriorated and rr increased from 30-48. what is the most appropriate management for this pt?,a. iv fluid,b. needle thoracocentesis,c. 100% oxygen,d. portable xr,,,,,,,key: the key is 100% oxygen.,"The most appropriate management for a 34-year-old man who experienced a decrease in Glasgow Coma Scale and an increase in respiratory rate after being involved in a road traffic accident would be to administer 100% oxygen. This is because the increase in respiratory rate indicates that the patient is likely having difficulty breathing and may not be getting enough oxygen. Administering 100% oxygen can help increase the amount of oxygen in the blood, improving the patient's symptoms and potentially preventing further complications. IV fluids and needle thoracocentesis would not be appropriate in this case as there is no indication of hypovolemia or a pneumothorax, and a portable X-ray would not be the immediate priority.",c,c,TRUE,
797. a 44yo lady who has pckd is concerned because her 38yo brother has just died of an intracranial insult. she knows he was not hypertensive. what was the most likely cause of her brother’s death?,a. subdural hematoma,b. subarachnoid hemorrhage,c. cerebral infarct,d. epidural hematoma,,,,,,,key: the key is b. subarachnoid hemorrhage. [cerebral aneurisms are recognized association of pckd which may lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"The most likely cause of the brother's death is subarachnoid hemorrhage (option B). This is because cerebral aneurysms are a recognized association of polycystic kidney disease (PCKD), which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhages. Subdural hematoma (option A), cerebral infarct (option C), and epidural hematoma (option D) are not commonly associated with PCKD and therefore less likely to have been the cause of the brother's death. Therefore, the most probable cause of the brother's death, given his age and lack of hypertension, is a subarachnoid hemorrhage.",b,b,TRUE,
798. a 36yo male dx with glioblastoma since last 5m has cerebral edema and is on dexamethasone. he has diarrhea and vomiting for the last 3days. he has been suffering from repeated falls today. what could be the possible cause for his falls?,a. adrenal insufficiency,b. dehydration,c. dexamethasone therapy,d. raised icp,,,,,,,key: the key is a. adrenal insufficiency. [prolonged dexamethason use suppresses adrenal axis and intercurrent illness can lead to adrenal insufficiency (addisonian crisis) in such cases].,"The correct answer to this question is A, adrenal insufficiency. Prolonged use of dexamethasone can suppress the adrenal axis and intercurrent illness can lead to adrenal insufficiency, or Addisonian crisis, in such cases. In this patient, he has been on dexamethasone for his cerebral edema, and is now experiencing symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting for the last 3 days, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Adrenal insufficiency is also a concern due to the added stress of his illness, which could cause an Addisonian crisis. The repeated falls could be a result of the weakness and fatigue associated with adrenal insufficiency. Dehydration and dexamethasone therapy may also contribute to his falls, but adrenal insufficiency is the most likely cause in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
799. a 2yo child is brought by his mother. the mother had hearing impairment in her early childhood and is now concerned about the child. what inv would you do?,a. audiometry,b. distraction testing,c. scratch test,d. tuning fork,,,,,,,"key: the key is a. audiometry. [conditioned response audiometry 2-4 years, pure tone audio gram for greater than 5 years, less than 6 months otoacoustic emission or brainstem evoked response, distraction test for 6-18 months, ohcs ent].","In this scenario, the correct answer would be a. audiometry. This is because the child in question is only 2 years old, which falls within the age range for a conditioned response audiometry test. Additionally, the mother's history of hearing impairment makes it a reasonable concern for the child to undergo a hearing evaluation. Distraction testing (option b) is typically used for children between 6-18 months of age and is not a suitable option for a 2-year-old child. Scratch testing (option c) and tuning fork testing (option d) are not appropriate tests for evaluating hearing in children. Therefore, the best course of action in this scenario would be to perform an audiometry test.",a,a,TRUE,

[recurrent abdominal pain and headaches with no abnormal finding on examination and investigation points to abdominal migraine. management is reassurance and prescribe analgesics].,"The correct answer is c, reassure. This child's symptoms are suggestive of abdominal migraine which is a type of migraine that affects the abdomen instead of the head. Therefore, conducting further imaging studies like an abdominal ultrasound or head CT is unlikely to be helpful and would only increase healthcare costs and radiation exposure. Instead, reassurance should be provided to both the child and their caregiver that there is likely no serious underlying medical condition causing the abdominal pain and that analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be prescribed as needed for pain management. The other answer choices are not appropriate as they are not relevant to the presentation and would not provide any additional information or treatment options for the patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
"801. a 78yo gentleman suddenly collapsed. his hr=120bpm, bp=70/40mmhg. exam: pulsatile mass in abdomen. what is the most appropriate dx?",a. aortic aneurysm,b. mesenteric cyst,c. umbilical hernia,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. aortic aneurism. [there is features of shock with pulse 120bpm and bp 70/40mmhg and sudden collapse of the patient with pulsatile mass in abdomen makes the likely diagnosis of ruptured aortic aneurism].,"The most appropriate diagnosis for the patient described is a. aortic aneurysm. The features of shock, including the patient’s increased pulse rate of 120bpm, lowered blood pressure of 70/40mmhg, and sudden collapse, along with the presence of a pulsatile mass in the abdomen, suggest a ruptured aortic aneurysm. This is a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention. The other options, b. mesenteric cyst and c. umbilical hernia, do not typically present with the same symptoms and physical exam findings as an aortic aneurysm. Therefore, they are less likely to be the correct diagnosis in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
802. a woman prv in good health presents with sudden onset of severe occipital headache and vomiting. her only physical sign on exam is a stiff neck. choose the most likely dx.,a. subarachnoid hemorrhage,b. subdural hematoma,c. cerebellar hemorrhage,d. migraine,e. cerebral embolus,,,,,,key: the key is a. subarachnoid hemorrhage. [sudden onset severe occipital headache and vomiting with stiffness makes the likely diagnosis to be subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The sudden onset of occipital headache, vomiting, and stiffness in the neck are classic symptoms of this condition. Subdural hematoma and cerebellar hemorrhage typically present with neurological deficits and are less likely given the lack of findings on physical exam. Migraine may cause severe headaches but typically does not cause a stiff neck. Cerebral embolus may cause symptoms similar to those seen in a subarachnoid hemorrhage, but the absence of any focal neurological deficits makes it a less likely diagnosis. Overall, given the patient's presentation, a subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
803. a 34yo housemaid presents with headaches in the back of her head for several days and pain on flexing her neck. what is the most likely cause?,a. subdural hemorrhage,b. cervical spondylosis,c. subarachnoid hemorrhage,d. meningitis,e. cluster headache,,,,,,key: the key is b. cervical spondylosis. [headache in the back of head and pain on flexing neck is early feature of cervical spondylosis which gradually progress to later symptoms like radiculopathies due to root compression in arms and hands].,"The most likely cause of the 34-year-old housemaid's symptoms of headaches in the back of her head and pain on flexing her neck is cervical spondylosis. This condition, which involves degeneration of the cervical spine, may initially present with these early symptoms, and may progress to more advanced symptoms such as radiculopathies due to root compression in the arms and hands. Subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and meningitis are less likely causes of these symptoms, as they tend to present with other, more severe symptoms such as confusion, altered consciousness, and fever, respectively. Cluster headache is also an unlikely cause, as it typically involves unilateral, severe pain accompanied by tearing and nasal congestion.",b,b,TRUE,
"804. a 40yo man complains of thirst and lethargy. his bp=140/90mmhg, corrected ca2+=3.7mmol/l. what is the most appropriate management at this stage?",a. iv fluids,b. prednisolone,c. iv hydrocortisone,d. calcium prep,,,,,,,key: the key is a. iv fluids. [hypercalcemia is treated by iv fluids].,"The correct answer is A, iv fluids. This is because the patient is presenting with symptoms of hypercalcemia, which is an excess of calcium in the blood. IV fluids can help to decrease calcium levels by increasing urine output and flushing out the excess calcium. Prednisolone and IV hydrocortisone are not appropriate treatments for hypercalcemia as they are steroids that are used to treat other conditions such as inflammation or autoimmune diseases. Calcium preparation is not appropriate because the patient already has high levels of calcium in their blood and giving them more calcium would exacerbate the problem. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient at this stage would be IV fluids.",a,a,TRUE,
805. a 75yo man on digoxin develops weakness in the right upper and lower limbs which resolves within a few hours. what is the most definitive inv for this condition?,a. carotid doppler,b. angiography,c. ct head,d. digoxin level,,,,,,,key: the key is b. angiography. probably wrong key! correct key is c. ct head. [patient on digoxin means he is being yreated for atrial fibrillation with heart failure and the cause of tia is cardiac in origine! so carotid dopplar or carotid angiography is not the answer. again for tia investigation of choice is mri (if not available ct) nice guideline. so for this question definitove investigation is ct scan.].,"The correct answer for this question is option c, ct head. The patient's use of digoxin suggests that he is being treated for atrial fibrillation with heart failure and the cause of his TIA is likely cardiac in origin. Therefore, carotid doppler or carotid angiography is not the appropriate investigation. The recommended investigation for TIA is MRI, but in its absence, CT is the next best option according to the guidelines set by NICE. Hence, CT scan is the definitive investigation in this case. Option d, digoxin level, is irrelevant to the patient's current symptoms and does not aid in the diagnosis of a TIA. Option b, angiography, is also incorrect since it is an invasive procedure and not the first line of investigation for TIA. Option a, carotid doppler, is only useful if the cause of the TIA is due to carotid artery stenosis, which has been ruled out as a potential cause for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,
"806. a 35yo man presents with balance problems, headache, snhl and loss of coreneal reflex on the left side. what is the most definitive inv?",a. ct scan of internal auditory meatus,b. nuclear imagine of the brain,c. mri of internal auditory meatus,d. mri brain,,,,,,,key: the key is d. mri brain. wrong key! “most definitive” is mri internal auditory meatus. [probable diagnosis is left sided acaustic neuroma. for this most definitive investigation is mri internal auditory meatus].,"The most definitive investigation for a 35-year-old man presenting with balance problems, headache, SNHL, and loss of corneal reflex on the left side is an MRI of the internal auditory meatus. This is because the probable diagnosis is left-sided acoustic neuroma, which can be best identified using this particular imaging modality. While a CT scan of internal auditory meatus may be helpful, it lacks the specificity and detail of an MRI. Nuclear imaging of the brain is also not as accurate or specific as an MRI of the internal auditory meatus. Finally, an MRI of the brain alone may not show the lesion that is causing the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most definitive investigation in this case is an MRI of the internal auditory meatus.",c,c,TRUE,

[in iritis there is flares and cells in anterior chamber. in iritis pupil may be irregular but in angle closure glaucoma pupil is slightly dilated and oval in shape. in iritis there is no halo around light but in glaucoma there is halo around light].,"The single most appropriate clinical diagnosis based on the given scenario is acute iritis, represented by option D. The presentation of a painful, red, photophobic eye with slightly blurred vision and watering for 3 days, along with cells and flare in the anterior chamber and a sluggish pupil reaction, are indicative of iritis. In contrast, acute close-angle glaucoma (option A) would present with a dilated and oval pupil, along with a halo around light. Acute conjunctivitis (option B) would not cause the presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber. Acute dacryocystitis (option C) would present with localized tenderness and swelling near the inner corner of the eye, and corneal foreign body (option E) would have a history of recent trauma or exposure to foreign objects. Therefore, based on the given symptoms and examination findings, acute iritis is the most appropriate diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,

The inguinal lymph nodes drain lymph from the lower limbs, external genitalia, perianal region and lower abdominal wall. Therefore, it is the most suitable choice for the specific location of the swelling. Option a, c, e, f, g and h are incorrect as they do not drain the specific area described. Option b, pre-aortic lymph node, is incorrect as it drains the organ systems of the intestines and retroperitoneum, which are not related to the swelling below the umbilicus on the right side.",d,d,TRUE,

This yeast-like fungus is a common cause of fungal infections, and it typically affects those with weakened immune systems or who have taken antibiotics for a prolonged period. Nesseria Meningitidis and Cryptococcus Neoformans are not commonly associated with painful swallowing. Isospora Belli usually causes diarrhea, and Mycobacterium Avium is more commonly associated with respiratory infections in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Candida Albicans.",c,c,TRUE,
"810. a 45yo lady complains of expressable galactorrhea, decreased libido and amenorrhea, weight gain and easy fatigue. her serum prolactin levels are 1100um/l. what is the likely cause of hyperprolactinemia?",a. hypothyroidism,b. stress,c. pregnancy,d. prolactin secreting pituitary tumor,e. pcos,,,,,,"key: the key is d. wrong key. correct key should be a. hypothyroidism. [ it is likely to be hypothyroidism because prolactin level in hypothyroidism may be 30-200ng/ml which means 630-4200 miu/l. though weight gain can occur but fatigue is not a feature of prolactinoma unless it is a macroadenoma causing suppression of other pituitary hormone! given prolactin level of 1100 iu/l is definitely from a microadenoma (in macroadenoma prolactin level is > 10,000 mu/l) which does not cause fatigue. so the case most likely seems to be hypothyroidism].","Based on the patient's symptoms and serum prolactin levels, the likely cause of hyperprolactinemia is hypothyroidism (not d - prolactin secreting pituitary tumor). In hypothyroidism, prolactin levels can range from 30-200ng/ml which translates to 630-4200 miu/l. Though weight gain can occur, fatigue is not a common feature of prolactinoma unless it is a macroadenoma causing suppression of other pituitary hormones. The patient's prolactin levels of 1100 iu/l most likely come from a microadenoma (prolactin levels in macroadenomas are >10,000 mu/l) which does not typically cause fatigue. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms and prolactin levels, hypothyroidism is the likely cause of hyperprolactinemia (not b - stress, c - pregnancy, or e - PCOS).",d,d,TRUE,

[sudden headache, vomiting, collapse are suggestive of sah].","The correct answer for this question is a. sah, which stands for subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is the most likely diagnosis in a 42-year-old female who experienced sudden, severe headache and vomiting, followed by collapse. These symptoms are suggestive of a ruptured cerebral blood vessel which leads to bleeding in the space between the brain and skull. In contrast, viral encephalitis would present with fever, altered mental status, and seizures, while meningitis would present with fever, headache, and stiff neck. Anaphylaxis, on the other hand, would present with sudden onset of hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the face or mouth. Thus, option a is the most likely diagnosis and the other options can be ruled out based on the patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,
812. parents of a 3m baby are worried about cot death. what advice would you give?,a. lay on the back with feet towards head end,b. lay on the back with feet towards feet end,c. lay on side,d. lay on stomach,,,,,,,key: the key is b. lay on the back with feet towards feet end.,"The correct advice to give parents of a 3-month-old baby who are worried about cot death is option b, which is to lay the baby on their back with feet towards the feet end. This sleeping position has been shown to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or cot death. It is important to avoid options c and d, which involve placing the baby on their side or stomach. This is because these positions can increase the risk of SIDS as they can make it harder for the baby to breathe. Therefore, parents should make sure that their baby is sleeping on a firm, flat surface and dressed in appropriate clothing to keep them warm rather than relying on a position that could put their baby at risk of SIDS.",b,b,TRUE,
813. a child born at 36wks developed difficulty in breathing with intercoastal recession and nasal flaring. his temp is normal but his mother had prom 48h ago. what is the most likely inv that will lead to tx?,a. blood culture,b. cxr,c. stool culture,d. sputum culture,,,,,,,key: b. cxr. this is wrong key! correct key is a. blood culture. [in neonates investigations of pneumonia is for sepsis as pneumonia at this age is always secondary to sepsis or a part of sepsis. probable diagnosis is neonatal pneumonia as there is respiratory signs and history of prom. in extremes of age pneumonia or sepsis may be with normal temperature or even there may be hypothermia. here pneumonia is a part of sepsis and investigation is not cxr but blood culture!].,"The correct answer for the given scenario is a. blood culture. In neonates, investigations for pneumonia aim to identify sepsis as pneumonia at this age is often secondary to sepsis or a part of sepsis. With the given symptoms of respiratory distress, intercostal recession, and nasal flaring, along with the history of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) in the mother, the probable diagnosis is neonatal pneumonia. It is important to note that in extremes of age, pneumonia or sepsis may present with normal temperature or even hypothermia. Here, since the likely diagnosis is neonatal pneumonia secondary to sepsis, the investigation of choice is a blood culture, not a chest x-ray (CXR), stool culture, or sputum culture. Therefore, the other options are incorrect answers for this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,
814. a 68yo man has had increasing dysphagia for solid food for 3m and has lost 5kgs in weight. what single inv is most likely to lead to a def dx?,a. barium swallow,b. cxr,c. ct chest,d. endoscopy and biopsy,e. video-fluoroscopy,,,,,,key: the key is d. endoscopy and biopsy. [likely cause is malignant stricture for which endoscopic biopsy is the definitive investigation].,"Out of the given options, the most appropriate investigation to lead to a definitive diagnosis for a 68-year-old man who has had increasing dysphagia for solid food for three months and has lost 5 kg in weight is endoscopy and biopsy (option D). This is because the likely cause of the dysphagia is a malignant stricture, for which endoscopic biopsy is the definitive investigation. A barium swallow (option A) may identify a narrowing but cannot determine the cause, while a CXR (option B) or CT chest (option C) would not provide relevant information for the diagnosis of dysphagia. Video-fluoroscopy (option E) may show swallowing problems, but it is not as definitive as an endoscopy and biopsy in diagnosing malignant strictures. Therefore, endoscopy and biopsy is the most appropriate investigation in this case.",d,d,TRUE,

[the likely diagnosis is rhabdomyolysis where renal failure occurs due to myoglobin (myoglobins are  released after breakdown of skeletal muscles)].,"The likely cause for this patient's renal failure is the release of myoglobin due to rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a condition where the breakdown of skeletal muscles leads to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can cause kidney damage and failure. In this case, the patient's thigh was crushed by a wardrobe, leading to prolonged compression and muscle breakdown. The presence of casts in his urine, along with hypocalcemia and high serum creatinine levels, suggest kidney damage. Acetylcholine and myotroponin are not typically associated with rhabdomyolysis or renal failure, and acetyl acetate is not a known cause of kidney damage. Therefore, the correct answer is b, myoglobin.",b,b,TRUE,

The linea alba is a connective tissue band that runs vertically down the midline of the abdomen and separates the left and right rectus abdominis muscles. Piercing this structure is ideal for accessing the abdominal cavity during surgery. The other choices - external iliac muscle, cricoid cartilage, rectus sheath muscle, duramater, 1st tracheal cartilage, conjoined tendon, and intercostal muscles - are all incorrect because they either do not run down the midline of the abdomen or would not provide suitable access for gallstone removal.",c,c,TRUE,

[dressler syndrome usually occurring two to five weeks after the initial event but it can be delayed for as long as three months.  it is characterised by pleuritic chest pain, low-grade fever and pericarditis].","The correct answer is E, Dressler Syndrome. Dressler Syndrome typically occurs 2-5 weeks after an initial cardiac event, but can be delayed for up to 3 months. It is characterized by pleuritic chest pain, low-grade fever, and pericarditis. The patient in this scenario has been experiencing continuous chest pain that worsens on inspiration, along with a low-grade fever and an elevated ESR level. Acute pericarditis presents with similar symptoms but typically occurs within a week of the initial cardiac event. Cardiac tamponade presents with more severe symptoms such as hypotension and dyspnea. Atrial thrombus and left ventricular aneurysm may have chest pain as a symptom but are not associated with fever or ESR elevation. Therefore, Dressler Syndrome is the most likely explanation for the patient's abnormal findings.",e,e,TRUE,

[as 4 hour paracetamol level is at critical level start iv n-acetyltine at once]. manaement of paracetamol poisoning: gi decontamination is recommended in those presenting <4h after od. activated charcoal 1g/kg (max 50g) is the treatment of choice, reducing serum levels more than gastric lavage and limiting liver injury. • glucose, u&e, lft, inr, abg, fbc, hco3 –; blood paracetamol level at 4h post-ingestion. • if <10–12h since overdose, not vomiting, and plasma paracetamol is above the line on the graph, start n-acetylcysteine. • if >8–24h and suspicion of large overdose (>7.5g) err on the side of caution and start n-acetylcysteine, stopping it if level below treatment line and inr/alt normal. ohcm, 9th edition, page 856].","The correct answer to this question is B, IV N-acetylcysteine. In cases of paracetamol poisoning, GI decontamination is recommended within 4 hours of overdose. Activated charcoal is the preferred treatment, as it helps to reduce serum levels more effectively than gastric lavage and limits liver injury. Blood tests should also be conducted, including measurements of glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, FBC, and HCO3, as well as a blood paracetamol level at 4h post-ingestion. If the overdose occurred less than 10-12 hours ago and the plasma paracetamol level is above the treatment line, IV N-acetylcysteine should be administered. In cases where the overdose occurred more than 8-24 hours ago and there is a suspicion of a large overdose (>7.5g), treatment with IV N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as a precaution, stopping it if the level drops below the treatment line and INR/ALT are normal. Gastric lavage and observation alone are not recommended treatments for paracetamol poisoning.",b,b,TRUE,
819. a pt dx with dvt is taking warfarin. what is his cut off inr limit?,a. <1,b. 1-2,c. 2-3,d. 3-4,,,,,,,key: the key is c. 2-3. [this range is appropriate for the prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism and reduction of the risk of systemic embolism for people with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease].,"The correct answer is c) 2-3. An INR value of 2-3 is appropriate for the prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism and reduction of the risk of systemic embolism for people with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease. This range represents a balance between efficacy and safety. A lower INR value (<2) may not provide enough anticoagulation to prevent clotting, while a higher INR value (>3) may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, options a (<1), b (1-2), and d (3-4) are incorrect because they are either too low or too high to be an appropriate cut off INR limit for a patient with DVT who is taking warfarin.",c,c,TRUE,
820. inserting a drain in the mid-axillary line. what is the single most appropriate anatomical structure?,a. external iliac muscle,b. linea alba,c. rectus sheath muscle,d. conjoined tendon,e. intercostal muscles,,,,,,key: the key is e. intercostal muscles.,"The single most appropriate anatomical structure when inserting a drain in the mid-axillary line is the intercostal muscles. These muscles are located between the ribs and play an important role in respiratory movements. They are also responsible for the expansion and contraction of the chest cavity during breathing. The external iliac muscle, linea alba, and conjoined tendon are not located in the mid-axillary line and are therefore not appropriate structures to consider. The rectus sheath muscle, also known as the rectus abdominis, is located in the abdominal region and is not relevant to this anatomical location. Therefore, the intercostal muscles are paramount in the insertion of a drain in the mid-axillary line.",e,e,TRUE,
"821. a 29yo man presents with hx of cough, weight loss and night sweats. exam: pansystolic murmur. what is the most appropriate dx of underlying cause?",a. malaria,b. hsp,c. hiv,d. dengue fever,,,,,,,key: the key is c. hiv. [though not mentioned iv drug abusers may have tricuspid regurgitation causing pansystolic murmur and hiv also very common in this group].,"The most appropriate diagnosis for this 29-year-old man with a history of cough, weight loss, and night sweats along with a pansystolic murmur on examination is HIV. This is because HIV infection is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including pulmonary and cardiac complications. Although malaria and dengue fever may present with fever and other flu-like symptoms, a pansystolic murmur is not typically associated with these conditions. Similarly, HSP (Henoch-Schönlein purpura), a condition characterized by inflammation of blood vessels, does not typically present with the symptoms described in this case. Therefore, HIV is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient based on the given clinical presentation.",c,c,TRUE,
822. a 15yo boy presents with recurrent breathlessness and wheeze especially after exercise. what is the most diagnostic inv?,a. cxr,b. lung function test,c. pefr,d. ct scan,,,,,,,key: the key is b. lung function test. [assessment of severity of airflow obstruction can diagnose asthma and copd].,"The correct answer to the question is b. lung function test. This test is essential to assess the severity of airflow obstruction and can diagnose respiratory conditions such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The lung function test measures the amount of air the patient can inhale and exhale, the speed at which they can do so, and how much air they can exhale in one second. In this case, the presentation of recurrent breathlessness and wheeze after exercise suggests asthma, making a lung function test the most appropriate and diagnostic investigation. The other options, such as a chest x-ray (CXR), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and CT scan, are not useful in diagnosing asthma and COPD. CXR is unlikely to reveal any abnormalities associated with these conditions, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is less sensitive than lung function tests in diagnosing asthma. CT scans are typically reserved for more complex diagnostic cases. In conclusion, a lung function test is the most appropriate diagnostic investigation for evaluating recurrent breathlessness and wheezing in a 15-year-old boy.",b,b,TRUE,

[described rash is erythema migrans which is characteristic skin lesion seen in lyme disease. lyme disease is treated with doxycycline].,"The correct answer is B. Doxycycline PO. This 34-year-old man is experiencing erythema migrans, which is a characteristic skin lesion seen in Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for Lyme disease. Penicillin, flucloxacillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and adrenaline are not appropriate treatments for Lyme disease. It is important to administer doxycycline as early as possible in the course of the disease to prevent the progression of Lyme disease to its more severe stages. Therefore, B. Doxycycline PO is the correct answer.",b,b,TRUE,
"824. a 60yo man was brought in by his wife complaining of ataxia, urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. he also complains of rigidity and slowing of movement with a pill rolling tremor of the hands. what is the likely dx?",a. parkinson’s disease,b. idiopathic parkinson’s disease,c. shy-drager syndrome,d. huntington’s disease,,,,,,,"key: the key is c. shy-drager syndrome. [shy-drager syndrome is characterized by parkinsonism (rigidity, slowing of movement with hand tremors) plus a more pronounced failure of the autonomic nervous system (urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction) and there may also cerebellar sign like ataxia be present]. [please note the discrepancy of this question (may be a bad recall) that classic pill rolling movement is not a feature of multiple system atrophy (shy-drager dsyndrome)].","Based on the patient's symptoms of ataxia, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction, along with rigidity, slowing of movement, and a hand tremor, the likely diagnosis is shy-drager syndrome or multiple system atrophy (MSA). Parkinson's disease typically presents with rigidity, bradykinesia, and a resting tremor, but not ataxia or autonomic dysfunction. Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is a subtype of Parkinson's disease where the cause of the disease is unknown, but it also does not typically present with ataxia or autonomic dysfunction. Huntington's disease is characterized by chorea or jerky involuntary movements, and does not usually involve ataxia or autonomic dysfunction. It is important to note that the question's mention of a pill rolling tremor is a bad recall and is not a feature of MSA.",c,c,TRUE,

[if judicial antibiotic fail to control fever next step is to add antifungal agents].,"In this case, the correct answer is b. Continuing antibiotics and adding IV antifungals is the appropriate next step when judicial use of antibiotics fails to control fever in a neutropenic patient. This patient is at high risk for fungal infection because of their malignancy and neutropenia. Adding oral antifungals is not recommended because the patient may not be able to absorb them due to their neutropenic state, and stopping antibiotics altogether would leave the patient vulnerable to infection. Only continuing present antibiotics is also not recommended as they have not been effective in controlling the fever. Therefore, the best option is to continue antibiotics and add IV antifungals to treat potential fungal infection.",b,b,TRUE,

[likely diagnosis is dka where abg is done to demonstrate acidosis].,"The correct answer is e. ABG. ABG stands for arterial blood gas, which is a blood test used to determine the pH levels in the blood. This test is essential in assessing the severity of acidosis in a patient suspected of having diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The symptoms presented by the young girl, including drowsiness, deep breathing, and dry mucous membranes, are consistent with DKA, and her very low sugar level of 20 confirms the likelihood of this diagnosis. Serum urea and blood culture are not relevant to the diagnosis of DKA and would not be appropriate initial steps in managing this patient. CT scans are not routinely indicated in the workup of DKA. HbA1c is a blood test that measures long-term blood sugar control and is not useful in an acute setting. Therefore, an ABG is the next appropriate step to take in this scenario.",e,e,TRUE,
"827. removal of a glioma, which single most appropriate anatomical structure will be pierced?",a. cricoid cartilage,b. rectus sheath muscle,c. duramater,d. conjoined tendon,e. intercostal muscles,,,,,,key: the key is c. duramater.,"The correct answer is c. duramater. The duramater is the tough outermost layer of the meninges that covers the brain and spinal cord. During the removal of a glioma, which is a type of brain tumor, the surgeon will need to pierce this layer in order to access the brain. In contrast, the cricoid cartilage (a) is located in the neck, the rectus sheath muscle (b) covers the abdominal muscles, the conjoined tendon (d) refers to a structure in the groin area, and the intercostal muscles (e) are located between the ribs. None of these structures are appropriate anatomical structures in the removal of a glioma. Therefore, the correct answer is c. duramater.",c,c,TRUE,
828. a child is not breathing and intubation failed. at what anatomical site should the incision be made?,a. external iliac muscle,b. cricoid cartilage,c. linea alba,d. rectus sheath muscle,e. duramater,f. 1st tracheal cartilage,g. conjoined tendon,h. intercostal muscles,,,key: the key is b. cricoid cartilage. [incision for tracheostomy is done which goes down from cricoids cartilage].,"In the case where a child is not breathing and intubation has failed, the appropriate anatomical site for an incision would be the cricoid cartilage, which is option B. This is because the cricoid cartilage is a ring-shaped structure that sits at the top of the trachea and serves as a landmark for accessing the airway. An incision made here would create an opening that allows for tracheostomy, a surgical procedure that involves accessing the trachea through the neck. It is important to note that the other options listed are incorrect because they do not provide access to the airway or are not relevant to the situation described. The external iliac muscle, linea alba, rectus sheath muscle, duramater, conjoined tendon, and intercostal muscles are either located in different parts of the body or have functions unrelated to the airway. The 1st tracheal cartilage is adjacent to the cricoid but is not as reliable a landmark for accessing the airway in emergency situations.",b,b,TRUE,
"829. a 10yo child who presented with fx of the radius which was treated with a plaster cast, complains of pain. exam: limb is swollen but warm and well perfused, pulses are present. what should you do next?",a. send for repeat xr,b. remove cast,c. replace cast with more padding,d. give analgesic,,,,,,,key: key is d. give analgesic.,"In this scenario, the correct answer is option d, 'give analgesic'. The child is experiencing pain which is a common complaint after a fracture. However, it is important to note that this pain should not be ignored as it can hinder the healing process. The swelling and warmth of the limb along with the presence of pulses indicates good circulation and is not a cause for concern. While options a and b may seem like viable options, they are not necessary at this point in time. Repeat x-rays may be needed if the child experiences significant pain or presents with symptoms of compartment syndrome, which is characterized by severe pain, numbness, and tingling. Removing the cast is also not necessary, as it can worsen the fracture and lengthen the healing process. Replacing the cast with more padding may provide temporary relief, but is not a long-term solution to managing the child's pain. Therefore, giving an analgesic is the most appropriate action to ease the child's pain and improve their overall comfort level.",d,d,TRUE,

[cervical lymphadenopathy mentioned in question which occurs in ebv infection. in ars (acute retroviral syndrome) or primary hiv infection there is generalized lymphadenopathy].,"Based on the patient's recent travel to Thailand and symptoms of cervical lymphadenopathy and fever, the most likely cause of his illness is EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus) infection which is commonly associated with lymphadenopathy. Choice a is incorrect because HIV infection typically presents with generalized lymphadenopathy, not just cervical. Choices c and d are unlikely causes as they are not typically associated with cervical lymphadenopathy. Therefore, the correct answer is b, EBV infection.",b,b,TRUE,

[minimal change gn is usually seen in young children. it presents as edema and proteinuria].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 6-year-old child who presents with edema and mild proteinuria but no hematuria is minimal change GN, with the key being ""c"". The minimal change GN is a common type of glomerulonephritis, often seen in young children, which manifests as edema and proteinuria. It is different from PSGN, which typically presents with hematuria and proteinuria and is characterized by a delayed onset after a streptococcal infection. Membranous GN is typically seen in adults and presents with proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. RPGN stands for rapidly progressive GN, a severe form of glomerulonephritis that manifests with rapidly declining kidney function and may result in renal failure. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is minimal change GN, given the age of the child and the absence of hematuria.",c,c,TRUE,

[elderly patient with ra is usually on nsaids which may lead to perforated peptic ulcer which presents as severe epigastric pain, vomiting and shoulder tip pain. diagnosis is made by seeing free gas shadow under the diaphragm on erect cxr].","The correct answer is f. erect CXR. Elderly patients with RA who are on NSAIDs are at a higher risk of developing a perforated peptic ulcer, which presents with the symptoms of severe epigastric pain, vomiting, and shoulder tip pain. The most discriminatory investigation is an erect CXR, as it is important to look for any free gas shadow under the diaphragm, which would confirm the diagnosis of a perforated peptic ulcer. The other options such as US abdomen, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, barium meal and upper GI endoscopy are not relevant in identifying a perforated peptic ulcer. Thus, the most appropriate single investigation for this case is f. erect CXR.",f,f,TRUE,

[holyday in sudan, hematuria, fever and hepatomegaly suggest schistosomiasis].","The most likely diagnosis for this man's condition is d. schistosomiasis. This is suggested by the fact that the patient has recently been on holiday in Sudan, and is now presenting with symptoms of red urine, fever, and hepatomegaly. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that is common in areas with poor sanitation and access to clean water, such as Sudan. The presence of bloody urine and hepatomegaly are characteristic signs of this disease. While the other choices, such as malaria, brucellosis, and leptospirosis, may also be contracted while visiting Sudan and cause fever, they are less likely to be associated with hematuria and hepatomegaly. Therefore, the best option for the most likely diagnosis would be schistosomiasis.",d,d,TRUE,

This is due to the association between weight loss in homosexuals and AIDS, which can lead to CMV retinopathy. Additionally, retinal hemorrhages are a recognized association of CMV infection. Mycobacterium avium (choice a), Hemophilus influenzae (choice c), NHL (choice d), and Pneumocystis jiroveci (choice e) are not commonly associated with weight loss and retinal hemorrhages in this patient population.

[v-ectopics if occurs in a normal heart though symptomatic it is benign in nature but if it is secondary to heart disease like mi it may precipitate to more life threatening arrhythmia like ventricular fibrillation].,"The most likely rhythm disturbance for this patient is v-ectopics as indicated by the key, which states that v-ectopics are benign when occurring in a normal heart and commonly present with palpitations that are not sustained. This is supported by the patient's complaint of her heart skipping a beat quite often but never being sustained. The other options, such as SVT, VT, VF, and A-fib are less likely based on the patient's symptoms. SVT would present with sustained palpitations, while VF and VT are more life-threatening arrhythmias that are unlikely to be symptomatic solely when the patient is trying to sleep. A-fib would present with a more irregular heartbeat and is less likely to be the cause of a consistent skipped beat.",d,d,TRUE,
"837. a 17yo has acute pain around his right eye, pain on one side of his face and ear ache too. what is the single most dx?",a. ear wax,b. ear foreign body,c. dental abscess,d. cellulitis,e. herpes zoster,,,,,,"key: the key is e. herpes zoster. [it seems to be herpes zoster of the trigeminal nerve. onset is acute, unilateral distribution favours herpes zoster].","The correct answer is e) herpes zoster. This is because the patient is presenting with acute pain around the right eye and on one side of their face, which is consistent with the distribution of the trigeminal nerve - the nerve that is commonly affected in herpes zoster. Additionally, the presence of ear pain can be attributed to the involvement of the ear branch of the same nerve. Ear wax (a) or an ear foreign body (b) would not present with these symptoms, and a dental abscess (c) would result in localized pain around the affected tooth rather than the entire face. Cellulitis (d) may have some overlap in presentation, but it would not be the single most likely diagnosis given the specific distribution of symptoms. Therefore, herpes zoster is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's presentation.",e,e,TRUE,

[itchy lesion and family history of asthma and hay fever in 1st degree relatives favours the diagnosis of eczema].,"The single most likely causative factor for the 12-year-old boy's symptoms is eczema (answer c). The presence of dry and red skin, along with itching, is a typical presentation of eczema. Additionally, the family history of asthma and hay fever in first-degree relatives is supportive of the diagnosis of eczema since it is often associated with allergies. Dermatitis herpitiformis (answer a) is a rare autoimmune disease that presents with itchy blisters, often seen in individuals with celiac disease. Scabies (answer b) is a parasitic infestation that causes intense itching, but typically presents with burrows and nodules on the skin. Uremia (answer d) is a condition where kidneys are unable to filter waste products from the blood, resulting in itchy skin, but it is not a common cause of itching in a 12-year-old boy.

Therefore, the most likely cause of itching and dryness in the boy's hands is eczema.",c,c,TRUE,
839. a 45yo man presented with pruritic purple papules on the flexor surface of his wrist and some white lacy markings on his buccal mucosa. what is the single most likely causative factor?,a. all,b. lymphoma,c. polycythemia,d. ida,e. lichen planus,,,,,,key: the key is e. lichen planus. [white lacy pattern of lesion is characteristic of lichen planus].,"The correct answer is e. Lichen planus. Lichen planus is a benign inflammatory condition that can present with pruritic purple papules on the flexor surfaces of the wrists and white lacy markings on the buccal mucosa. The key characteristic of lichen planus is the white lacy pattern of the lesion. The other answer choices are incorrect and not associated with the presentation described. All, lymphoma, polycythemia, and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are not known causative factors of lichen planus. Therefore, the single most likely causative factor for the patient's presentation is lichen planus.",e,e,TRUE,

[in unconsciousness in diabetics, first glycemic change should be excluded by doing rbs].","In a diabetic patient with sudden loss of consciousness, the initial investigation should be to exclude any glycemic changes. Therefore, the correct answer is b. rbs. Checking the patient's blood sugar levels is important because hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can cause unconsciousness in diabetics. CT scan (a) or MRI (c) may be needed depending on the cause of unconsciousness, but they are not the initial investigation. ECG (d) is used to assess heart function, and ABG (e) is used to assess blood gases, neither of which are helpful in determining the cause of sudden loss of consciousness in a diabetic patient.",b,b,TRUE,
841. a 36yo lady comes with hx of early morning stiffness of her small joints and with red and painful eye. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. iris,b. ciliary body,c. cornea,d. conjunctivitis,e. sclera,f. lichen planus,,,,,"key: the key is e. sclera. [ocular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis is scleritis (red, painfull eye)].","The correct answer for this question is e. sclera. Based on the patient's early morning stiffness of small joints and red and painful eye, the most suitable option would be scleritis, which is an ocular manifestation commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. This condition involves inflammation of the sclera, which causes severe eye pain, redness, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. The other options, including iris, ciliary body, cornea, conjunctivitis, and lichen planus, are not associated with early morning stiffness of small joints and painful eye. Therefore, selecting any of these options would not be appropriate for the given patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate option for this patient is e. sclera.",e,e,TRUE,
842. a 23yo man comes with 2d hx of sticky greenish discharge from the eyes with redness. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. iris,b. ciliary body,c. cornea,d. conjunctivitis,e. sclera,,,,,,key: the key is d. conjunctivitis. [bacterial conjunctivitis can cause sticky greenish discharge].,"The correct answer is d, conjunctivitis, because the patient's symptoms - sticky greenish discharge and redness - are consistent with bacterial conjunctivitis. The conjunctiva is a thin membrane that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye, and it can become infected by bacteria which leads to conjunctivitis. Iris (a part of the eye responsible for controlling the size of the pupil), ciliary body (a part of the eye that produces aqueous humor), cornea (the clear outermost layer of the eye), and sclera (the white outer layer of the eye) are all unrelated to the patient's symptoms and therefore, are not appropriate options for treatment.",d,d,TRUE,
"843. a pt was admitted with erectile dysfunction, reduced facial hair and galactorrhea. what is the most probable dx?",a. hyperprolactinemia,b. cushing’s syndrome,c. pheochromocytoma,d. hyperthyroidism,e. hypoparathyroidism,,,,,,key: the key is a. hyperprolactinemia.,"The correct answer to the question is a. hyperprolactinemia, which is the excessive production of prolactin hormone by the pituitary gland. This hormone regulates several physiological functions, such as milk production in females. In males, high levels of prolactin can interfere with the production of testosterone, leading to symptoms such as erectile dysfunction and reduced facial hair. Galactorrhea, which is the secretion of milk from the breast in the absence of pregnancy or breastfeeding, is another common symptom of hyperprolactinemia. Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism do not typically present with these symptoms and, therefore, are not the most probable diagnosis for the patient's condition.",a,a,TRUE,
844. a 32yo man has been repeatedly admitted to hospital for what was described as anxiety or panic attacks and palpitations. on occasions he is found to be tremulous and hypertensive. a persistent weight loss is noted. what is the most probable dx?,a. hyperthyroidism,b. panic attacks,c. pheochromocytoma,d. cushing’s disease,e. gad,,,,,,key: the key is c. pheochromocytoma.,"The most probable diagnosis for the 32-year-old man with repeated hospital admissions for anxiety or panic attacks, palpitations, tremulousness, hypertension, and persistent weight loss is pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that develops in the adrenal gland, causing the gland to produce excessive amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones cause symptoms such as palpitations, anxiety, hypertension, and weight loss. The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the given symptoms. Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, palpitations, and anxiety, but it is less likely to cause hypertension and tremulousness. Panic attacks and GAD can explain some of the symptoms but do not account for the hypertension and weight loss. Cushing's disease, which is caused by excessive cortisol production, can cause weight gain rather than weight loss. Therefore, the correct answer is c - pheochromocytoma.",c,c,TRUE,
845. a 35yo man with t1dm is dehydrated with bp of 90/50mmhg. what is the single most appropriate initial inv?,a. abg,b. cbc,c. hba1c,d. lft,e. serum urea,,,,,,key: the key is a. abg. [dehydration with low bp points towards probable dka. so from the given options abg is the best response].,"The correct answer to this question is a. ABG, because dehydration with low blood pressure is indicative of probable DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), which is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate attention. ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis is helpful in diagnosing DKA and guiding its management, as it provides information about acid-base balance, electrolyte status, and blood glucose levels. CBC (complete blood count), HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), LFT (liver function test), and serum urea may also provide valuable information in managing diabetes, but they are not the most appropriate initial tests for a patient presenting with signs of DKA. Therefore, the answer a. ABG is the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,
846. in ogtt what is the glucose venous plasma level 2h after glucose intake which indicates impaired glucose tolerance?,a. >11.1mmol/l,b. between 7.8-11.0mmol/l,c. between 8.0-10.9mmol/l,d. between 10.0-11.0mmol/l,e. between 7.1-11.0mmol/l,,,,,,key: the key is b. between 7.8-11.0mmol/l.,"The correct answer is B, between 7.8-11.0mmol/L. During an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), glucose is ingested and blood samples are taken at intervals to measure the body's ability to handle glucose. A plasma glucose level between 7.8-11.0mmol/L at the 2-hour mark after glucose intake indicates impaired glucose tolerance. This means that the body is not able to process glucose effectively and may be a precursor to developing Type 2 diabetes. Answer options A, D, and E all indicate hyperglycemia, which is a condition where glucose levels are too high, but may not necessarily indicate impaired glucose tolerance. Option C falls within the range of impaired glucose tolerance, but it is not as specific as option B.",b,b,TRUE,

[the direct coombs test, is used to determine whether the cause of hemolytic anemia, is due to antibodies attached to rbcs which are seen in autoimmune-related hemolytic anemia].","The most appropriate investigation for the young man presenting with jaundice, low hgb, and occasional spherocytes seen on blood film is the direct Coombs test (answer: b). This test is used to determine whether hemolytic anemia is caused by antibodies that are attached to red blood cells (RBCs), which can occur in autoimmune-related hemolytic anemia. In this case, the presence of spherocytes indicates that the RBCs are being destroyed in circulation, leading to the low hgb and jaundice. The other options are less appropriate because: a) G6PD enzyme assay is used to diagnose G6PD deficiency and is not typically associated with spherocytes on blood film, c) repeat blood film could confirm the presence of spherocytes but does not diagnose the underlying cause, d) indirect Coombs test is used to detect antibodies in the patient's serum before a blood transfusion and is not typically associated with hemolytic anemia, and e) BMA (bone marrow aspiration) is not necessary at this stage and is not typically used to diagnose hemolytic anemia.",b,b,TRUE,

[a finger that bends down at the end joint and cannot be straightened is called a mallet finger. it is caused by an injury to the extensor tendon that straightens (extends) the finger. a splint worn day and night for 6-8 weeks will cure the problem in most cases].,"The correct answer is c. mallet finger. This deformity is caused by an injury to the extensor tendon that straightens the finger, which is precisely what this patient has experienced. A mallet finger is characterized by the finger bending down at the end joint and being unable to straighten. A splint worn day and night for 6-8 weeks is usually effective in correcting this problem. The other answer choices are not related to an injury of the extensor tendon and would not be expected based on the patient's diagnosis. A dinner fork deformity typically results from a fracture of the distal radius, while a game keeper thumb is a type of injury to the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb. Gun-stock deformity and garden spade deformity are not commonly used medical terms and would not be relevant to this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,

The x-ray can show fusion of both SI joints and thin, symmetrical syndesmophytes bridging the intervertebral disc spaces, which are indicative of ankylosing spondylitis. ESR (answer a) and HLA-B27 (answer c) tests can support the diagnosis but are not specific. An x-ray of the thoracic spine (answer d) or CT scan of the lumbar spine (answer e) may show changes consistent with ankylosing spondylitis, but the sacroiliac joint x-ray is the most specific investigation for this condition.",b,b,TRUE,

[the clinical features described are consistent with urinary tract infection for which clean catch of urine is the next best investigation].,"The correct next best investigation for the 4-year-old girl with symptoms of feeling unwell, urinary urgency and a high temperature of 39°C is a clean catch of urine, with the key being the letter ""b"". The clinical presentation described is consistent with a urinary tract infection, and clean catch of urine is the standard diagnostic test to confirm this. Choice ""a"" (catheter catch of urine) may be considered in some cases, but clean catch is less invasive and is the preferred option in children. Choice ""c"" (US) and ""d"" (IVU) are imaging techniques that may be used to evaluate certain urinary tract abnormalities, but they are not recommended as a first-line investigation for urinary tract infection. Lastly, choice ""e"" (suprapubic catch of urine) is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for infants who are unable to provide a clean catch specimen. Therefore, the best option in this scenario is a clean catch of urine.",b,b,TRUE,

The key to the question is that the correct investigation that is most likely to lead to a diagnosis is the CXR or chest X-ray. The features mentioned, such as crepitations heard on auscultation and low oxygen saturation, are indicators of a respiratory infection. The other choices, such as blood and urine tests, are not the most relevant investigations for this particular case. Blood tests for culture and sensitivity (C&S), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urine for C&S, and CSF analysis are not typically conducted as the first line of investigation for a respiratory infection, which is why options a, b, d, and e are not the correct answers. Therefore, option c, the CXR, is the most appropriate investigation for aiding in the diagnosis and management of the 2yo girl's probable pneumonia.",c,c,TRUE,

Encephalitis and meningitis are both possible diagnoses, but it is difficult to differentiate between the two. Encephalitis is typically caused by a viral infection and involves symptoms of altered brain function, while meningitis also has a viral predominance but displays symptoms of pain and misery with initially normal mental processes. CSF analysis alone cannot differentiate between these two conditions, so imaging such as MRI is necessary. However, in this case, there are features of raised intracranial pressure, and a CT or MRI-guided lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain CSF. Therefore, CSF analysis is the most likely single investigation to lead to a diagnosis.

A positive dipstick test for leukocytes or nitrites is suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), but to confirm the diagnosis, urine C&S is necessary. Blood for C&S, ESR, CXR, and CSF analysis would be less likely to lead to a diagnosis of a UTI as they are not specific to UTIs. Blood for C&S would be more useful in diagnosing systemic infections, ESR is a marker of inflammation and not specific to any particular condition, CXR would rule out respiratory infections, and CSF analysis would be used to diagnose central nervous system infections. Therefore, urine for C&S is the most appropriate investigation in this scenario to diagnose the potential UTI.",d,d,TRUE,

The investigation of choice for septicemia is a blood culture (a). The other options listed are less likely to lead to a diagnosis in this case as follows: ESR (b) and CXR (c) are not specific to septicemia and are unlikely to reveal the underlying cause of the illness. Urine for C&S (d) is unlikely to be positive given the clean dipstick result. Finally, CSF analysis (e) is not indicated at this stage as there is no indication of meningitis.

[practically it is established that majority of vur will cure with time with prophylactic antibiotics and need no surgery! only a minority needs surgery].,"If a child is diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), it is important to inform the parents that antibiotic prophylaxis is required. This is the correct answer as studies have shown that the majority of VUR cases can be treated with prophylactic antibiotics, and surgery is only required in a minority of cases. This is in contrast to option (b), which suggests that most cases will require surgery, which is incorrect. Option (c) also provides incorrect information as most children with VUR will not experience kidney scarring by age five. Option (d) is also not helpful as there are options available for treating VUR. Option (e) is just a filler and does not provide any information to the parents. Therefore, the correct information to share with the parents of a child with VUR is that antibiotic prophylaxis is required.",a,a,TRUE,

[the question is incomplete and is not suitable for further discussion with such little info].,"In the case of a 2-year-old child presenting with severe vomiting and a mass felt in the abdomen, the most appropriate investigation is option a, an ultrasound. Ultrasound is non-invasive and can help identify the location, size, and nature of the mass without exposing the child to unnecessary radiation or discomfort. Options b and c, an X-ray and CT scan respectively, may provide valuable information but expose the child to radiation which can be harmful in high doses. Option d, a complete blood count (CBC), is not useful in identifying the cause or location of the mass and is not an appropriate investigation in this scenario.

[dx is laryngitis].,"The correct answer is A, none required. This is because the girl's symptoms and direct laryngoscopy findings strongly suggest laryngitis, which is usually a self-limiting condition that does not require any specific treatment or further investigation. Sputum for AFB (B) is only indicated if there is a suspicion of tuberculosis, which is not supported by the clinical picture described, while laryngoscopy (C) and bronchoscopy (D) are invasive procedures that may be reserved for cases with more severe symptoms or if there is a suspicion of other underlying conditions such as tumors or foreign bodies. X-ray cervical spine (E) is not relevant to the current presentation.

[if child refuse local exam then exam under ga].,"The correct answer to this question is a. Local exam. This is because the bright red staining of the underpants could be due to trauma or injury from horse riding. Therefore, a local exam will help identify any signs of injury or trauma. Exam under GA is not recommended unless there is a compelling reason to do so, and it may cause unnecessary discomfort to the child. Continuing regular child care or informing child protection services are not appropriate actions at this stage as more information is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. Finally, the coagulation profile is not relevant in this case since there is no evidence to suggest a bleeding disorder. Overall, a local exam is the most appropriate next action and will help identify the cause of the bright red staining.",a,a,TRUE,

It is normal for newborns to lose some weight within the first week, and then start gaining it back again. Therefore, there is no immediate cause for concern regarding the baby's weight loss. Checking the child protection register or informing the police is not necessary in this situation, as there is no indication of abuse or neglect. Nutritional assessment and skeletal survey are also not needed, as there are no signs of malnutrition or bone fractures. Continuing regular child care ensures that the baby receives proper care and attention as they continue to grow and develop.",d,d,TRUE,

[septal abscess takes a bit more time and a considerable portion of case of septal hematoma is associated with fever].,"The most likely diagnosis in a 6-year-old child who fell on their nose 2 days ago and is now presenting with difficulty breathing and a fever is a septal hematoma. This is the correct answer because a septal hematoma is a collection of blood in the nasal septum which can cause difficulty breathing and may lead to infection and fever if left untreated. Nasal polyps and a deviated nasal septum may also cause breathing difficulties, but are less likely in this scenario as the nasal bones are straight. Septal abscess is an unlikely diagnosis because it typically takes longer to develop and is not often associated with a fever. Therefore, based on the given information, the single most likely diagnosis would be a septal hematoma.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the patient has a history of recurrent chest infections and the symptoms he presents with are characteristic of a respiratory tract infection. Pneumococcal pneumonia and Mycobacterium TB are also possible causes of the symptoms but are less likely compared to Staphylococcus. Pseudomonas and PCP are less likely to be the causative organisms in this case since they are commonly seen in patients with cystic fibrosis which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

Coagulation profile. The child's presentation with bruises on the buttocks and a history of a recent runny nose suggests a possible diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), which can be associated with coagulation abnormalities such as hypoprothrombinemia and elevated plasma d-dimer levels. Checking the child protection register (option a) or informing the police (option e) may be appropriate in cases of suspected abuse, but in this scenario, there is no evidence to suggest abuse or neglect. A skeletal survey (option c) may be indicated in cases of suspected physical abuse, but this is not the most likely diagnosis in this situation. Continuing regular child care (option d) is not the most appropriate action when there is concern for a possible medical condition. Therefore, the single most appropriate next action is to perform a coagulation profile to assess for any potential bleeding or clotting abnormalities associated with HSP.",b,b,TRUE,

This condition is a medical emergency that requires prompt management as it can rapidly progress to complete airway obstruction and respiratory failure. Acute asthma (option A), bronchiolitis (option B), croup (option C), and tonsillitis (option E) may also cause respiratory distress in children, but they do not typically present with drooling saliva and constant noisy breathing. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is epiglottitis, and immediate management with airway support and antibiotic therapy is crucial to prevent further complications.",d,d,TRUE,

This occurs as a side effect of chemotherapy drugs, which can damage the nerves in the body. Bone mets to cervical vertebrae are less likely to cause these symptoms, as they typically result in pain and weakness rather than neuropathy. Hyponatremia and hypocalcemia can cause a range of symptoms, but they are not specifically associated with neuropathy in the fingertips. Therefore, the correct answer is B, post-chemo neuropathy, as it is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms based on the information provided.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are primarily caused by bacterial colonization on the surface of the catheter. Therefore, changing the catheter can reduce the risk of recurring infections. Prolonged use of antibiotics (answer B) may lead to antibiotic resistance and potentially harmful side effects in elderly patients. Bladder wash (answer C) might be helpful in some cases, but it is not a primary treatment for CAUTIs.

"866. a 35yo male typist who suffered a scaphoid fx was treated with a scaphoid cast. after 2wks when the cast was removed for a review xr, it was found that he had problems in moving the thumb, index and middle fingers. what would you suggest as the management for the recent prb?",a. release of flexor retinaculum,b. release of common flexor sheath,c. release of palmar sheath,d. ulnar nerve release,e. fasciotomy,,,,,,key: the key is a. release of flexor retinaculum. [now case of carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve compression)].,"The correct answer for the management of the recent problem in the 35-year-old male typist with scaphoid fracture is option A - release of flexor retinaculum. This is because the patient is exhibiting symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by the compression of the median nerve in the wrist. The flexor retinaculum is a thick ligament that forms a tunnel in the wrist through which several tendons and nerves pass, including the median nerve. Therefore, releasing the flexor retinaculum can relieve the compression on the median nerve and alleviate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because they do not address the specific problem of median nerve compression in the wrist.",a,a,TRUE,
867. a pt on insulin is booked in for a hernia operation. what is the most appropriate management of insulin?,a. give insulin and saline pre-op,b. stop insulin for the duration of the op,c. give iv insulin + dextrose + saline pre-op,d. give insulin as usual pre-op,e. none,,,,,,key: the key is c. give iv insulin + dextrose +  saline pre-op.,"The most appropriate management of insulin for a patient booked for a hernia operation is to administer IV insulin, dextrose and saline pre-operatively. This is because insulin therapy is required to control the patient's blood sugar levels and prevent hyperglycemia during the surgery. However, stopping insulin or giving insulin and saline pre-op alone may result in hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous condition. Administering IV insulin, dextrose and saline ensures that the patient's blood sugar levels are properly controlled and do not fall too low during the operation. Therefore, giving insulin as usual pre-op or no treatment at all (option e) is not appropriate for this situation. By giving IV insulin, dextrose and saline pre-op, the patient's safety and well-being are ensured during the surgery.",c,c,TRUE,
868. a 35yo male who recently had an appendicectomy has got severe pain in his right big toe. joint is red and swollen. he consumes 30 units of alcohol/week. what is the most probable dx?,a. rhabdomyosarcoma,b. osteoarthritis,c. gout,d. pseudogout,e. arthritis,,,,,,key: the key is c. gout. [alcoholic drinks can raise the level of uric acid in the blood].,"The correct answer is c. gout. Gout is a type of arthritis that occurs when there is an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints and surrounding tissues. The elevated levels of uric acid in the blood can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption, among other factors. The patient's symptoms of severe pain, redness, and swelling of the big toe are consistent with gout, which commonly affects the joints in the lower extremities. Rhabdomyosarcoma, osteoarthritis, and pseudogout are less likely differential diagnoses in this case, as they typically present with different symptoms and risk factors. Arthritis cannot be considered a definitive diagnosis as it is a broad term that encompasses many different types of joint inflammation. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for this patient is gout due to his alcohol consumption and typical presentation of symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
"869. a 25yo male who recently noticed change in his shoe size, he is also constipated, has a preference to hot weather, his skin is dry, has severe pain in wrist joint. joint is red and swollen. what is the most probable dx?",a. chondro-sarcoma,b. lipo-sarcoma,c. gout,d. pseudogout,e. ankylosing spondylitis,,,,,,"key: the key is d. pseudogout. [hypothyroidism (change of shoe size due to myxedema (or pedal oedema can be seen in hypothyroidism) , other features of constipation, cold intolerance, dry skin are well known features of hypothyroidism.) has well recognized association with pseudogout].","The most probable diagnosis is d. pseudogout. Pseudogout is a type of arthritis characterized by sudden and severe pain, redness, and swelling in one or more joints. The symptoms are similar to gout, but instead of uric acid crystals, calcium pyrophosphate crystals accumulate in the joint, causing inflammation and damage. The patient's change in shoe size is associated with hypothyroidism, which is a well-recognized risk factor for pseudogout. Other features such as constipation, dry skin, and cold intolerance also suggest hypothyroidism. Chondro-sarcoma and lipo-sarcoma are tumors and are unlikely to present with joint symptoms. Gout is also a type of arthritis, but it is typically associated with elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, which the patient hasn't mentioned. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the spine and is unlikely to present with sudden joint symptoms. Therefore, pseudogout is the most probable diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,
870. a 45yo woman had her visual acuity checked at her local optician. 12h later she presents to the ed with severe pain and redness in her eye. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. iris,b. ciliary body,c. ant chamber,d. post chamber,e. cornea,,,,,,key: the key is c. [in acute angle closure glaucoma half-dilated pupil is the most likely position which precipitates an acute attack as the trabecular meshworks are mostly closed by peripheral anterior synechia of peripheral iris in this position. and mild illuminated darkened room like of an optician (also use of mydriatics accelerates this)  or opera (cinema hall) are culprit to make this! as the block occurs in anterior chamber it is the likely option here].,"The correct answer is c. anterior chamber. In acute angle closure glaucoma, a half-dilated pupil puts the trabecular meshwork mostly closed by peripheral anterior synechia of peripheral iris in a position that can precipitate an acute attack. Activities such as being in a mildly illuminated darkened room, like an optician's office, or watching a movie in a cinema hall can accelerate this blockage. As the blockage occurs in the anterior chamber, this is the likely option in this case. The other choices are not correct as they are not involved in the pathophysiology of acute angle closure glaucoma.",c,c,TRUE,
871. a 75yo man who has dm and htn experiences acute monocular blindness which resolves after 1h. what is the most likely dx?,a. gca,b. optic neuritis,c. lacunar infarct,d. pontine hemorrhage,e. amaurosis fugax,,,,,,key: the key is e. amourosis fugax.,"The correct answer is e. Amaurosis fugax, which refers to temporary loss of vision in one eye caused by a disruption in blood flow to the eye. This condition commonly affects older adults with risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, as in the case of the 75-year-old man described in the question. Option a, giant cell arteritis (GCA), is less likely given the temporary nature of the vision loss and the absence of other characteristic symptoms of GCA. Option b, optic neuritis, is unlikely given the age of the patient and the absence of other symptoms such as eye pain and reduced color vision. Option c, lacunar infarct, and option d, pontine hemorrhage, are both associated with more permanent symptoms and would not resolve within an hour. Therefore, option e is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's acute monocular blindness.",e,e,TRUE,
"872. a 26yo presents with prolonged constipation, blood on side of stool and very painful defecation. pr exam: very painful. what is the single most likely dx?",a. ca colon,b. uc,c. cd,d. anal fissure,e. constipation,,,,,,key: the key is d. anal fissure.,"The correct answer is d, anal fissure. The symptoms presented by the patient, such as prolonged constipation, blood on one side of the stool, and painful defecation, are indicative of an anal fissure. Anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anal canal, and it is commonly caused by hard and dry stools, leading to trauma during defecation. This can result in pain during bowel movements and spotting of blood on the stool. Option a, ca colon, is less likely as this condition usually presents with other symptoms such as weight loss, change in bowel habits, and an altered appetite. Option b, uc, and c, cd, are less likely as they are inflammatory bowel diseases that present with chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. Option e, constipation, may cause some symptoms similar to anal fissure, but it does not typically involve blood on the stool. Thus, the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms is anal fissure.",d,d,TRUE,
873. a 35yo man with painless left testicular enlargement for the past 6m which is increasing in size and 3x larger than the right side. there is no tenderness or redness. what is the most likely dx?,a. testicular tumor,b. hydrocele,c. epididymal cyst,d. epididymo-orchitis,e. reassure,,,,,,key: the key is a. testicular tumour.,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is a testicular tumor. The history is suggestive of a painless left testicular enlargement which has been increasing in size for the past 6 months and is now 3 times larger than the right side. These are classic features of a testicular tumor. The absence of tenderness or redness rules out epididymo-orchitis while the lack of transparency on transillumination argues against hydrocele. Epididymal cyst can also present as a painless testicular swelling but they do not grow as rapidly as a testicular tumor. Reassurance is not the appropriate management for a testicular tumor as it requires further evaluation and treatment. Therefore, the correct answer is a testicular tumor and the other choices are incorrect based on the history presented.",a,a,TRUE,
"874. a middle aged man who has had a hx of chronic sinusitis, nasal obstruction and blood stained nasal discharge. he now presents with cheek swelling, epiphora, ptosis, diplopia, maxillary pain. what is the single most likely dx?",a. nasopharyngeal ca,b. pharyngeal ca,c. sinus squamous cell ca,d. squamous cell laryngeal ca,e. hypopharyngeal tumor,,,,,,key: the key is c. sinus squamous cell ca.,"Based on the symptoms provided, the single most likely diagnosis for the middle-aged man is sinus squamous cell carcinoma. Sinus squamous cell carcinoma often presents with symptoms such as chronic sinusitis, nasal obstruction, and blood-stained nasal discharge, which the patient in question has a history of. The additional symptoms of cheek swelling, epiphora, ptosis, diplopia, and maxillary pain also suggest a probable diagnosis of sinus squamous cell carcinoma, as these symptoms are commonly associated with this type of cancer. While the other options presented, such as nasopharyngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, squamous cell laryngeal cancer, and hypopharyngeal tumor, all have potential to cause similar symptoms, based on the given information, they are not the most likely diagnosis. Therefore, the answer to the question is c. sinus squamous cell carcinoma.",c,c,TRUE,
"875. a 60yo man with a long hx of smoking and alcohol presents with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, diplopia, otalgia and conductive deafness. what is the single most likely dx?",a. nasopharyngeal ca,b. pharyngeal ca,c. sinus squamous cell ca,d. squamous cell laryngeal ca,e. hypopharyngeal tumor,,,,,,"key: the key is a. nasopharyngeal ca. [nasal obstruction, epistaxis are features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma; with cranial nerve palsy, diplopia due to 6th nerve, (also 5th and 12th cranial nerves are frequently affected) otalgia and conductive deafness from local extension as mentioned can occur].","The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a. nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The presence of nasal obstruction and epistaxis are common features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Diplopia due to 6th nerve palsy, as well as involvement of the 5th and 12th cranial nerves, are also frequently seen. Otalgia and conductive deafness are due to local extension of the tumor. Pharyngeal cancer, sinus squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell laryngeal cancer, and hypopharyngeal tumors typically present with different symptoms and do not involve the same cranial nerves as nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore, they are less likely to be the correct diagnosis for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,
"876. a 60yo is on tx for ihd, htn and hyperlipidemia. during the night he complains of wheeze and sob. which of the following meds is responsible for that?",a. amlodipine,b. atenolol,c. ramipril,d. simvastatin,e. bendroflumethiazide,,,,,,key: the key is b. atenolol. [asthma can be precipitated by beta blockers].,"The correct answer is b, atenolol. Atenolol is a beta-blocker, and beta-blockers can precipitate asthma symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath. Amlodipine, ramipril, simvastatin, and bendroflumethiazide are unlikely to cause asthma symptoms. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, ramipril is an ACE inhibitor, simvastatin is a statin, and bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It is important to note that asthma has many triggers and a thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. Consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended for any changes in medication or the appearance of new symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
877. a 15yo boy who complains of pain in his leg which has settled with aspirin. what is the most probable dx?,a. leomyosarcoma,b. liposarcoma,c. painful hip,d. exostosis,e. osteod osteoma,,,,,,key: the key is e. osteoid osteoma. [younger age of onset and relieved with aspirin favours the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma].,"The most probable diagnosis for a 15-year-old boy who complains of leg pain that is relieved by aspirin is e. osteoid osteoma. This is due to the younger age of onset and the pain relief with aspirin which are both characteristic of this condition. Leomyosarcoma and liposarcoma are both malignant tumors and are unlikely to present with pain relief from aspirin. Painful hip could be a possible diagnosis, but it does not explain the relief with aspirin. Exostosis is a benign bone tumor that could cause pain, but again, it is not relieved with aspirin. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is osteoid osteoma.",e,e,TRUE,
878. a 20yo fit man suddenly developed severe lower back pain as getting up from bed. what is the single most probable dx?,a. paget’s disease,b. multiple myeloma,c. pid,d. as,e. spondylosis,,,,,,key: the key is c. pid [prolapsed intervertebral disc]. [sudden onset of lower back pain and felt more during forward bending or similar movement like getting up from bed favours the diagnosis of pid].,"The correct answer is C, prolapsed intervertebral disc (PID). PID is the most probable diagnosis in a 20-year-old fit man who suddenly developed severe lower back pain when getting up from bed. This is because the symptoms of PID include sudden onset of lower back pain that is often worsened by activities such as forward bending or getting up from bed. Paget's disease and multiple myeloma are bone-related conditions that do not typically present with sudden onset lower back pain. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that often presents with lower back pain that worsens with rest, and spondylosis is a degenerative condition that usually affects people over the age of 50. Therefore, neither of these conditions are likely in a 20-year-old with sudden onset of lower back pain.",c,c,TRUE,
"879. a 60yo man brought to the ed with fx hip, he is deaf and has bilateral pedal edema. what is the single most probable dx?",a. paget’s disease,b. osteoporotic fx vertebra,c. secondary,d. multiple myeloma,e. spondylosis,,,,,,key: the key is a. paget’s disease. [h/o deafness and evidence of heartfailure like pedal edema favours the diagnosis of paget’s disease].,"The correct answer is a) Paget's disease. Paget's disease is a benign bone disorder that results in bone deformities and fractures. The patient's history of deafness and presence of pedal edema are indicative of potential complications of Paget's disease, such as hearing loss and heart failure. Osteoporotic fx vertebra is less likely as the patient's chief complaint is a hip fracture, and secondary and multiple myeloma are less common in this age group. Spondylosis is also less probable as the patient's symptoms do not suggest spinal involvement. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Paget's disease.",a,a,TRUE,
880. an 80yo lady presents with pain on left 6th rib for a week. it is non-tender on examination. what is your most likely dx?,a. herpes zoster,b. costochondritis,c. bone degeneration,d. thoracic vertebra compression,,,,,,,key: the key is c. bone degeneration.,"The correct answer for the most likely diagnosis for an 80-year-old lady presenting with left 6th rib pain for a week, which is non-tender on examination, is bone degeneration. This is because bone degeneration is a natural process that occurs as people age, particularly in women who are more prone to osteoporosis. The bones become weaker and more brittle, which can lead to fractures and pain even with minor trauma. Herpes zoster is a viral infection that usually causes a painful rash and blistering in a limited area of the skin, which does not apply in this case. Costochondritis is inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone, which would usually be tender on examination. Thoracic vertebra compression is a condition where the vertebra in the spine collapses, causing pain, but usually, it is not limited to one specific rib, and it would not be non-tender on examination. Therefore, bone degeneration is the most likely diagnosis in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,
"881. a 68yo dm, htn with a 45pack/year smoking hx, has left sided chest pain increased with breathing. exam: myosis on left side and wasting of small muscles of left hand. what is the single most appropriate dx?",a. costochondritis,b. lung cancer,c. good pasture’s syndrome,d. mnd,e. progressive massive fibrosis,,,,,,"key: the key is b. lung cancer. [smoking history, chest sign and horner’s syndrome points towards lung cancer (probable pancoast tumour)].","Based on the patient's smoking history, left-sided chest pain that worsens with breathing, and physical exam findings of myosis on the left side and wasting of small muscles in the left hand, the most appropriate diagnosis is lung cancer, specifically a probable pancoast tumor. Costochondritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and progressive massive fibrosis do not explain the combination of symptoms and exam findings. MND, or motor neuron disease, may cause wasting of muscles, but is not a likely diagnosis given the patient's other symptoms. Therefore, lung cancer is the most likely and appropriate diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
882. a 34yo man had a cold 2d back. he now presents with right sided facial pain. what is the single most likely dx?,a. maxillary sinus,b. ethmoid sinus,c. septal hematoma,d. septal abscess,e. allergic rhinitis,,,,,,key: the key is a. maxillary sinus. [maxillary sinusitis].,"The correct answer is a. Maxillary sinusitis. The patient's presenting symptoms of right-sided facial pain after having a cold is indicative of an infection in the maxillary sinus, which is the largest paranasal sinus and is commonly affected by sinusitis. Ethmoid sinusitis and septal hematoma/abscess are less likely as they do not typically present with unilateral facial pain, and allergic rhinitis does not typically cause facial pain.",a,a,TRUE,
883. a 29yo man with hx of asthma comes with post nasal discharge and bilateral painless nasal blockage. what is the single most likely dx?,a. nasal polyp,b. septal hematoma,c. septal abscess,d. atopic rhinitis,e. allergic rhinitis,,,,,,key: the key is a. nasal polyp.,"Based on the patient's symptoms of post nasal drip and bilateral painless nasal blockages, the most likely diagnosis is a nasal polyp. This is a growth in the lining of the nasal passages that is typically noncancerous and can lead to a reduction in airflow, causing blockage and discomfort. Septal hematoma and abscess typically present with pain, swelling, and tenderness, while atopic and allergic rhinitis may involve itching, sneezing, and runny nose. Therefore, they are less likely to be the diagnosis for this particular case.",a,a,TRUE,
884. a 24yo man has been found unconscious in an alleyway with a rr=6bpm and hr=60bpm. his pupils are constricted. what is the best tx?,a. methadone,b. naloxone,c. naltrexone,d. thiamine,e. glucose,,,,,,key: the key is b. naloxone. [respiratory depression and miosis points towards opiates poisoning for which antidote naloxone is given].,"The correct answer is b. Naloxone. The patient's respiratory depression and constricted pupils suggest an opiate overdose. Naloxone is a known antidote for opiate poisoning, which works by rapidly reversing the effects of opiates on the body. Methadone and naltrexone are not appropriate choices in an acute setting as they are used in addiction treatment programs. Thiamine and glucose are indicated for the treatment of alcohol-related conditions such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and hypoglycemia, respectively, neither of which are relevant to the patient's presentation. Therefore, naloxone is the best option for treating this patient's opiate overdose.",b,b,TRUE,
"885. a 23yo female presents with back pain and early morning stiffness, also complaining of eye problem and her sister has a similar condition. what is the single most probable dx?",a. paget’s disease,b. pid (pelvic inflammatory disease),c. myofacial pain,d. as (ankylosing spondylitis),e. spondylosis,,,,,,key: the key is d. as [back pain with early morning stiffness and uveitis points towards the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis].,"The correct answer is d. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) as the patient's symptoms of back pain with early morning stiffness and uveitis are characteristic of AS, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine. Additionally, the fact that the patient's sister has a similar condition increases the likelihood of AS being the correct diagnosis. Paget's disease (a bone disorder), PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), myofascial pain (muscle pain), and spondylosis (degenerative disc disease) are less likely diagnoses as they do not typically present with uveitis and are not typically hereditary.",d,d,TRUE,
886. a 63yo female with a hx of osteoporosis suddenly falls on her outstretched hand while shopping. xr shows fx at distal radius with backward shift of the distal fragment. what is the single most probable deformity?,a. dinner fork deformity,b. coxavara,c. mallet finger,d. cubitus valgus,e. garden spade deformity,,,,,,key: the key is a. dinner fork deformity.,"The correct answer to the question is a. dinner fork deformity. This deformity is often seen in cases of distal radius fractures, which commonly occur as a result of a fall on an outstretched hand, especially in individuals with osteoporosis. The dinner fork deformity is characterized by a backward shift of the distal radius fragment, leading to a typical appearance of the wrist on x-ray, resembling a fork handle. The other options listed - coxavara, mallet finger, cubitus valgus, and garden spade deformity - are unrelated to distal radius fractures and are not a likely consequence of the type of injury suffered by the patient in question. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is a. dinner fork deformity, based on the patient's clinical history and the characteristic appearance of the fracture on x-ray.",a,a,TRUE,
887. a 60yo man presents with severe colicky pain from his right flank radiating to his groin. his urinalysis reveals trace blood cells. what is the single most discrimatory inv?,a. us abdomen,b. xr kub,c. colonoscopy,d. upper gi endoscopy,e. laproscopy,,,,,,key: the key is a. us abdomen. [features are of ureteric colic. x-ray kub may miss radiolucent stones so us abdomen is the discriminatory inv].,"The correct answer is a) US abdomen as it is the most discriminatory investigation for features of ureteric colic. X-ray KUB may miss radiolucent stones, and colonoscopy, upper GI endoscopy, and laparoscopy are not indicated in the evaluation of ureteric colic. The severe colicky pain from the right flank radiating to the groin and the presence of trace blood cells in urinalysis suggest the presence of a kidney stone. US abdomen is the preferred imaging modality for the initial evaluation of suspected ureteric colic as it can identify radiolucent stones, stones in the upper ureter, and hydronephrosis, which can help guide appropriate treatment. Therefore, US abdomen is the single most discriminatory investigation for this presentation.",a,a,TRUE,
"888. a 45yo man has been admitted for an elective hernia surgery. 3d later he presents with agitation, sweating, aggressiveness, and complains of seeing snakes on the hosp wall. chlordiazepoxide has been started for this pt. what is the most appropriate next step?",a. diazepam,b. acamprosate,c. disulfiram,d. thiamine,,,,,,,key: the key is d. thiamine. [dx is delirium tremens. so following chlordiazepoxide thiamine is the appropriate next step].,"The correct answer for the next appropriate step is d. Thiamine. The patient's presentation and history suggest that he may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal leading to delirium tremens (DX). Chlordiazepoxide is an appropriate initial treatment for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, but the next step should be to administer thiamine as this patient may have a thiamine deficiency due to chronic alcohol abuse. This is important because administering glucose in the absence of thiamine administration may worsen thiamine deficiency and lead to Wernicke encephalopathy. Diazepam, acamprosate, and disulfiram are not appropriate next steps in this scenario and do not address the thiamine deficiency. Thus, thiamine supplementation is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.",d,d,TRUE,
889. a woman with a prv hx of pain at the left wrist following a fall 4m ago for which she didn’t seek any tx now presented with pain in the same wrist below the thumb and the pain is aggravated whenever she holds her baby. what is the cause?,a. fx radial head,b. scaphoid fx,c. carpal tunnel syndrome,d. colles fx,e. ulnar fx,,,,,,key: the key is b. scaphoid frature.,"The correct answer is b. scaphoid fracture. This is because the patient has a previous history of wrist pain following a fall, and the current pain is located below the thumb and aggravated by holding a baby, which requires a lot of wrist movements. These are all common symptoms of a scaphoid fracture. The other choices are less likely because a fx radial head would cause pain on the outer part of the wrist, carpal tunnel syndrome would cause numbness or tingling in the wrist and hand, colles fracture would cause a deformity in the wrist, and ulnar fracture would cause pain on the inner part of the wrist. Therefore, based on the patient’s history and symptoms, a scaphoid fracture is the most likely cause of her current wrist pain.",b,b,TRUE,
"890. a 29yo man was involved in an rta. he presents with distended neck veins, clear breath sounds and a trachea which is in the midline. his rr=34bpm, bp=60/0mmhg. what is the most likely dx?",a. simple pneumothorax,b. tension pneumothorax,c. cardiac tamponade,d. pericarditis,,,,,,,"key: the key is c. cardiac tamponade. [distended neck vein, clear breath sound and no tracheal shift and bp of 60/0 points towards cardiac tamponade].","Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is c. cardiac tamponade. The distended neck veins, clear breath sounds, and lack of tracheal shift suggest that there is not a pneumothorax present. Additionally, the very low blood pressure coupled with the patient's tachypnea could indicate a condition such as cardiac tamponade, which occurs when fluid or blood builds up in the pericardial sac and compresses the heart. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and hypotension. Pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the pericardial sac, can also present with similar symptoms but would not typically cause such a severe drop in blood pressure. Therefore, option d. pericarditis, is less likely to be the correct answer.",c,c,TRUE,
"891. an elderly woman is found anemia. as part of her exam, she had a barium enema which reveals a mass lesion in the ascending colon. what is the single most appropriate dx?",a. sigmoid volvulus,b. anal fissure,c. sigmoid carcinoma,d. cecal carcinoma,e. diverticular disease,,,,,,key: the key is d. cecal carcinoma. [mass in assending colon and anaemia makes cecal carcinoma the likely diagnosis from the given options].,"Based on the information provided, the single most appropriate diagnosis for an elderly woman with anemia and a mass lesion in the ascending colon seen on a barium enema would be d. cecal carcinoma. This is because cecal carcinoma is commonly associated with features such as anemia and a mass in the ascending colon. The other answer choices are less likely to be the correct diagnosis based on the given information. Sigmoid volvulus, anal fissure, and diverticular disease do not typically present with a mass lesion in the ascending colon. Sigmoid carcinoma is a possibility, but cecal carcinoma is a more likely diagnosis given the location of the mass. Overall, cecal carcinoma is the most appropriate diagnosis given the patient's characteristics.",d,d,TRUE,
892. a 55yo male after gastrectomy developed anemia. his mcv=106fl. exam: loss of proprioception and vibration sense. what is the most likely dx?,a. ida,b. folate def,c. vit b12 def,d. anemia of chronic disease,,,,,,,key: the key is c. vit b12 def. [gastrectomy –> deficiency of intrinsic factor –> vitamin b12 def. leading to macrocytic anemia and resulting subacute combined degeneration of cord causing loss of proprioception and loss of vibration sense].,"The correct answer is C, vitamin B12 deficiency. After gastrectomy, there is a deficiency of intrinsic factor which leads to a vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency causes macrocytic anemia, which is characterized by an elevated MCV level (>100fl). In addition to anemia, Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord which results in loss of proprioception and loss of vibration sense. The other answer choices (A, B, D) do not match the clinical features and laboratory values presented by the patient and are therefore incorrect. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) presents with low MCV, folate deficiency anemia presents with high MCV, and anemia of chronic disease presents with normal or low MCV.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the patient in the scenario developed acute abdominal pain and distention in the upper abdominal area, which are symptoms commonly associated with acute gastric dilatation. Additionally, the aspiration of 2 liters of coffee-ground fluid via a Ryles tube also supports this diagnosis. The other answer choices, such as reactionary hemorrhage, subphrenic abscess, DVT, and left lower lobe atelectasis, do not fit with the patient's symptoms or medical history.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient is currently on furosemide, digoxin, and isosorbide mononitrate, which suggests that he is experiencing heart failure. Diuretic resistance is a common problem in moderate and severe heart failure patients, which can be addressed by adding another diuretic. Since the patient is still experiencing pulmonary edema and volume overload despite the usage of loop diuretics, a thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide could be added to improve the result and reduce volume overload, resulting in better breathing. Ramipril, atenolol, amlodipine, and diltiazem are not appropriate for this case as they are not diuretics and do not address the volume overload issue.",b,b,TRUE,

[as the man’s hand was hanging outside the ot table there was pressure on radial nerve at arm level which is similar lesion of saturday night palsy].,"Based on the presented symptoms, the affected nerve is likely the radial nerve (option a). Wrist drop and sensory loss over the dorsum of the hand are indicative of radial nerve injury, which can occur when there is pressure on the nerve at the arm level, as was the case with the man's hand hanging outside the table during the operation. Options b, c, d, and e are unlikely as they do not innervate the areas affected by the reported symptoms. The ulnar nerve innervates the palmar surface of the hand and the digits. The median nerve innervates the palmar aspects of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger, as well as the dorsal tips of these fingers. The axillary nerve supplies the shoulder muscles and the skin over the deltoid. The brachial nerve does not exist.",a,a,TRUE,
896. what is the mode of spread of chicken pox?,a. airborne,b. close contact,c. fecal-oral,d. blood,e. vector,,,,,,key: the key is a. airborne.,"The correct answer to the question is a. airborne. Chickenpox spreads through the air by inhaling the virus from someone who has the disease or from their coughs and sneezes. Close contact, fecal-oral, blood, and vector are not the mode of spread for chickenpox. Close contact may increase the possibility of spreading the disease, but it is not the primary method of transmission. Fecal-oral and blood are not modes of transmission for chickenpox, while vector-borne diseases are spread through the bites of infected insects or animals, which is not the case for chickenpox. Therefore, the only possible answer is a. airborne.",a,a,TRUE,

The Weber test, which lateralizes to the right ear, suggests that there is a sensory neural hearing loss in the left ear. The most appropriate investigation is an MRI of the brain as auditory involvement, including acoustic neuroma, is better visualized with MRI than CT. X-rays and caloric testing are not helpful in this scenario. Therefore, option B (MRI brain) is the most appropriate investigation for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,
898. a 67yo man presents to the ed with pain in his left groin. he suddenly collapses and he is not able to move or lift his leg. he is on alendronate. what is the dx?,a. fx of neck of femur,b. post hip dislocation,c. fx of shaft of femur,d. pelvic base fx,e. peripheral vascular disease,,,,,,key: the key is a. fx neck of femur. [use of alendronate indicates osteoporosis where fracture neck of femur is more common].,"The correct answer is A, fracture of the neck of the femur. The patient is a 67-year-old man who presents with sudden onset of pain in his left groin, followed by collapse and inability to move or lift his leg. He is on alendronate, which is a medication used to treat osteoporosis. The use of alendronate indicates that the patient may have osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures, especially in the neck of the femur. Choice B, post hip dislocation, is less likely because there is no history of trauma or injury. Choices C, D, and E are also less likely because they do not explain the sudden onset of pain and inability to move the leg. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a fracture of the neck of the femur, which can occur spontaneously in patients with osteoporosis.",a,a,TRUE,

IV fluids. This is because the patient is suspected to have a femur fracture and is presenting with a low blood pressure of 90/60mmhg, which could indicate shock. IV fluids would help to stabilize the patient's blood pressure and prevent further complications. Option a, X-rays, may be necessary for diagnosis but is not the immediate action required in this situation. Option c, putting on a leg splint, could potentially worsen the patient's condition if they are in shock, as this could cause further blood loss. Option d, sending bloods for investigation, may also be necessary but is not the immediate action required. Option e, US nan nan nan nan nan, is not a valid answer.",b,b,TRUE,

[likely diagnosis is lung cancer, so best investigation for this is ln biopsy].","The best investigation for this patient is a lymph node biopsy. Based on his age, history of smoking, and presenting symptoms, he is at a high risk for lung cancer. The presence of consolidation and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on the CXR further supports this suspicion. A lymph node biopsy is the most definitive test for diagnosing lung cancer, as it allows for direct visualization and analysis of the affected tissue. The other choices are not the best options for this patient. Pleural fluid cytology may be helpful in diagnosing mesothelioma or other pleural tumors, but not lung cancer. CT and MRI are imaging modalities that may provide additional information, but cannot definitively diagnose lung cancer. Lastly, ultrasound is not as informative as other imaging studies in evaluating for lung cancer. Therefore, a lymph node biopsy is the best option for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,
"901. a 27yo pt met with a rta. while the ngt is passing, bowel sounds are heard in the chest. cxr shows ngt curled. what is the dx?",a. diaphragm rupture,b. aortic rupture,c. splenic rupture,d. bowel rupture,e. liver rupture,,,,,,key: the key is a. diaphramatic rupture.,"The correct answer to the question is a diaphragmatic rupture. This occurs when there is a tear or a hole in the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. In this case, the bowel sounds heard in the chest indicate that the abdominal contents may have moved through the tear in the diaphragm and into the chest cavity. The curled NGT on the CXR also suggests this diagnosis. 

Option b, aortic rupture, is unlikely as there is no indication of major bleeding, and the bowel sounds suggest the content is not blood. Options c, d, and e, splenic rupture, bowel rupture, and liver rupture, respectively, do not present with bowel sounds in the chest on physical examination and are unlikely based on the described symptoms. Therefore, diaphragmatic rupture is the most likely diagnosis. Further imaging studies and diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the extent of the injury.",a,a,TRUE,

[patient is obese type 2 diabetic. so biguanide is the tx of choice].,"In this scenario, the appropriate management for the patient's uncontrolled blood sugar would be the administration of a biguanide, specifically metformin. This is the drug of choice for type 2 diabetes patients who are obese, as it helps to reduce glucose production in the liver and improve insulin sensitivity. The other answer choices - sulfonylurea, insulin, glitazone, and sulfonylurea receptor binder - are less appropriate for this patient. Sulfonylurea drugs can cause weight gain and are generally not recommended for obese patients. Insulin may be effective, but it is typically reserved for cases where oral medications have failed to control blood sugar. Glitazone medications have been associated with an increased risk of heart failure and other adverse effects, making them a less desirable option. Finally, sulfonylurea receptor binders are a newer class of diabetes medications with limited research and evidence supporting their effectiveness. Therefore, metformin would be the best choice for this patient based on his obesity and failure to respond to lifestyle modifications.",a,a,TRUE,

This is evidenced by the patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, cough, and wheeze, as well as the spirometry results indicating a pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of 64% and a post-bronchodilator ratio of 65%. The presence of a table spoonful of mucopurulent sputum for the last 18 months also supports this diagnosis. Bronchiectasis is less likely as this condition typically presents with copious purulent sputum. Asthma may present with similar symptoms, but the spirometry results in this case do not support an asthma diagnosis. Lung fibrosis and sarcoidosis may also present with dyspnea but would not typically have the cough and sputum production seen in chronic bronchitis. Therefore, chronic bronchitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case based on the patient's symptoms and spirometry results.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient's symptoms, including tachypnea (>24 breaths/min) and hypercapnic respiratory acidosis (pH range 7.10-7.35), indicate the need for NIPPV as it can effectively improve gas exchange and reduce respiratory muscles fatigue. Other options such as intubation and ventilation may be invasive and carry a higher risk of complications, while LABA, toxapram, and amoxicillin are not appropriate for this patient's respiratory distress. Therefore, NIPPV should be promptly initiated to improve the patient's respiratory function and avoid further deterioration of their condition.",a,a,TRUE,

[discharge from ear and tragal tenderness are features of otitis externa. key treatment is aural toileting. drop advised is sofradex (framycetin + dexamethasone) ohcs, 9th edition, page 542].","The next appropriate medication for this patient would be d. steroid drop with antibiotic. The patient presents with symptoms of otitis externa, which is an infection of the outer ear canal. The treatment for otitis externa includes aural toileting to remove any debris or discharge from the ear canal, followed by the use of antibiotic and steroid ear drops. The antibiotic helps to clear the infection while the steroid reduces inflammation and relieves symptoms such as tenderness. Oral antibiotics or IV antibiotics would likely not be necessary in this case as the infection appears to be localized to the ear canal. Similarly, oral steroids would not be as effective as the steroid drop that can be applied directly to the affected area. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for this patient is d. steroid drop with antibiotic.",d,d,TRUE,

[foot drop, weakness of extensors of the ankle and toes and diminished pin prick sensation over the dorsum is sugestive of compression of common peroneal nerve].","The correct answer is a. Compression of the common peroneal nerve. Based on the presented symptoms, which include foot drop, weakness of ankle and toe extensors, and diminished pin prick sensation on the dorsum of the foot, it is suggestive of compression of the common peroneal nerve. This nerve passes behind the head of the fibula and can get compressed during casting or trauma to the area. The ankle jerk is present, which suggests that the tibial nerve and S1 nerve root are not involved. Rupture of the Achilles tendon would cause weakness of plantar flexion, not dorsiflexion, and would not result in diminished pin prick sensation. Finally, the medial collateral ligament injury is unrelated to the presented symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

[abc protocol].,"In this scenario, the correct answer would be b. Put airway. This is because the young man is unconscious and unresponsive, which indicates a potential airway obstruction. Putting in an airway would ensure that the patient is able to breathe and receive oxygen. The other options, such as turning the patient and putting them in the recovery position or assessing their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), are important steps but they are not the most urgent priority in this situation. Additionally, endotracheal intubation and starting CPR would only be necessary if the patient stops breathing or their heart stops beating, respectively, which is not mentioned in the scenario.",b,b,TRUE,

Based on the presenting symptoms of left ventricular pain and fever, and the results of an echo showing a systolic murmur, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is infective endocarditis. This is a serious infection that affects the heart valves, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly. In order to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism, a blood culture is indicated. Option a) CT and b) US are imaging studies that would not be helpful in diagnosing infective endocarditis. Option c) CXR is a useful tool in evaluating respiratory symptoms but is not useful in diagnosing infective endocarditis. Option e) LFT is not relevant to the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.

This is in line with the recommended protocol for step-up therapy for asthma. Beclomethasone is already a controller medication he is taking regularly and increasing the dose may not necessarily improve his symptoms and may increase the risk of side effects. Regular salbutamol and budesonide may provide some relief but may not address the underlying issue of nocturnal symptoms and may increase the risk of adverse effects. Sodium cromoglycate may also provide some relief, but its efficacy in treating nocturnal symptoms is limited. Oral steroids should be reserved for severe exacerbations of asthma and should not be used for long-term management. Inhaled steroids are already part of his current treatment regimen, and simply increasing the dose may not necessarily improve his symptoms and increase the risk of side effects. Therefore, adding a LABA would be the most appropriate solution to address his nocturnal symptoms.",c,f,corrected,

This is because the histology of the tumor reveals sheets of large polygonal or giant multinuclear cells, which is characteristic of large cell carcinoma. It is a poorly differentiated malignant epithelial tumor and often represents squamous cell carcinoma. The other choices are unlikely because small cell carcinoma typically appears as small blue cells with little cytoplasm, adenocarcinoma usually presents as glandular structures, and oat cell carcinoma is a type of small cell carcinoma.

This condition is characterized by inflammation and partial tears in the supraspinatus tendon, which can cause pain during certain movements like arm abduction. The pain typically occurs in a 'painful arc,' meaning it starts when the arm is raised sideways and continues through the middle part of the arc as the tendon impinges under the acromion. However, the pain is usually relieved as the arm reaches 180 degrees (vertical). Choices a, b, c, and e are unlikely causes of the woman's pain based on her presentation and hx of trauma. Rupture of the long head of biceps (choice a) is typically associated with an acute injury or degenerative changes, while sprain of the acromio-clavicular ligament (choice b) would produce pain around the joint itself rather than during arm abduction. Tendinitis of the abductor sheath (choice c) would also produce pain in a different location and may be associated with other symptoms like weakness.

Buccal prochlorperazine. The man's symptoms suggest he may be suffering from Meniere's disease, which causes vertigo for approximately 12 hours, accompanied by nausea/vomiting, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The disease can also cause sensorineural deafness and occur in clusters of less than 20 times per month. The cause is still a mystery, and diagnosis may involve electrocochleography or endolymphatic space MRI. Prochlorperazine is the recommended first-line treatment, especially if the patient is experiencing vomiting. Alternatives to prochlorperazine are betahistine (16mg/8h PO) or chlorthalidone.

A soft and freely mobile mass that has been progressively growing over the past six months hints towards a benign tumor such as a lipoma or a cyst. FNAC is a non-invasive diagnostic procedure that can accurately diagnose the nature of the lump by extracting a sample of the cells through a fine needle and analyzing them under a microscope. CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are imaging tests that can support the diagnosis of the mass, but do not provide a definitive diagnosis. X-ray is not useful in diagnosing soft tissue masses. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is a non-specific test that is not required for this case. Therefore, the best investigation for this patient is to undergo FNAC to confirm the diagnosis and decide the appropriate management plan.",a,a,TRUE,

[qrs complex is chaotic, wide, bizarre and irregular which is characteristic of ventricular fivrillation].","Based on the provided ECG, the most likely diagnosis for the 63-year-old man who collapsed during a wedding is ventricular fibrillation (VF), which corresponds to choice c. The chaotic and irregular QRS complex, characterized by wide, bizarre waves, is indicative of VF. On the other hand, ventricular tachycardia (VT) usually presents with a regular pattern of wide QRS complexes, which is not seen in this ECG. Atrial fibrillation (a-fib) and atrial flutter (a-flutter) are supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), which have narrow QRS complexes and are also not consistent with the presented ECG. Thus, choice c, VF, is the most likely diagnosis for the patient in question.",c,c,TRUE,

[though psa is a bit higher than normal it is not confirmatory of carcinoma! but loss of appetite and weight loss are highly suggestive of cancer in this 75yrs old man. active surveillance is offered first for low gleason score. esp at age of 75. and any other treatment depending on extension of tumor will be offered after excluding mets].,"Based on the patient's age, symptoms, and elevated PSA level, the most likely diagnosis is prostate cancer. However, confirmation of carcinoma cannot be solely based on PSA level, which is only indicative of the possibility of cancer. Loss of appetite and weight loss are also highly suggestive of cancer in this elderly patient. Active surveillance may be offered for low Gleason scores in patients aged 75, and any other treatment will be offered after ruling out metastases. Therefore, the correct answer is not radical prostatectomy (option A) but rather a multimodal approach that depends on the extension of the tumor and the patient’s overall health status. Turp (option B) and cryosurgery (option C) are not curative treatments and only provide symptomatic relief. Brachytherapy (option D) can be considered in low-risk patients, but it is not optimal for intermediate or high-risk cases. External beam irradiation (option E) may be used in combination with other therapies but may also result in adverse events. Ultimately, the choice of treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and the patient’s overall health status, and a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary.",a,a,TRUE,

MRI. To further evaluate for a suspected scaphoid fracture, a dedicated 'scaphoid' series should be requested. If the result is negative and fracture is still suspected, MRI has been shown to be sensitive and cost-effective in detecting scaphoid fractures. CT can be an alternative if MRI is unavailable. Immobilization with cast (a) can be done if no fracture is detected on x-ray, but MRI or CT is not available. Repeat x-ray (b) alone is not sufficient to detect a suspected scaphoid fracture. Surgery (d) is only indicated in a displaced scaphoid fracture. Choosing none (e) is not appropriate as the patient presents with symptoms that require further management.",c,c,TRUE,

[likely diagnosis is squamous cell lung cancer (as the patient is smoker) causing siadh and resulting hyponatremia].,"The correct answer is c. hyponatremia. This is due to a condition called SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), which is a common complication of lung cancer, especially in smokers. In SIADH, the body produces too much antidiuretic hormone, leading to retention of water and dilution of sodium, causing hyponatremia. The other choices are unlikely to occur in this case. Hyperkalemia is not typically associated with lung cancer and can be seen in conditions like renal failure. Hypocalcemia is more often seen in parathyroid disorders or in metastases to bone due to its role in bone metabolism. Hypernatremia is seen in conditions like diabetes insipidus, which is rare in lung cancer. Hypomagnesemia is seen in other conditions like malabsorption, alcoholism, and medication-induced causes, which are less likely in this case.",c,c,TRUE,
923. a 56yo man who is hypertensive recently underwent a change in meds. 2days later he developed wheezing. which drug can cause this?,a. atenolol,b. ramipril,c. bendroflumethiazide,d. verapamil,e. furosemide,,,,,,key: the key is a. atenolol. [beta blockers can precipitate asthma attacks].,"The correct answer is a. Atenolol. This drug belongs to a group of medications called beta-blockers, which are commonly used to treat hypertension. However, they can also cause bronchial constriction and precipitate asthma attacks in patients with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is due to the fact that beta-blockers inhibit the effects of beta-2 receptors, which are responsible for bronchodilation. The other choices are unlikely to cause wheezing. Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor, which can cause a dry cough, but not wheezing. Bendroflumethiazide and furosemide are diuretics that can cause electrolyte imbalances but not respiratory symptoms. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker and is not known to cause bronchial constriction. Therefore, the correct answer is a. atenolol.",a,a,TRUE,

[it is a case of community acquired pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae].,"The correct answer to this question is a. gram +ve diplococci, as the symptoms described are characteristic of a community acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This organism is a gram-positive diplococcus, which is commonly responsible for bacterial pneumonia. The other choices listed, such as coagulase-positive cocci, Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) cold agglutinins, acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and gram-negative diplococci, are unlikely to be the cause in this particular case. Therefore, the most likely organism causing pneumonia in this patient is limited to a gram-positive diplococcus, which would be best treated with antibiotics such as amoxicillin or doxycycline.",a,a,TRUE,
925. a young man’s arm was caught in a machine. xr showed no fx but arm is very swollen. what is the best tx?,a. plaster cast,b. wide splint with upward position,c. analgesics,d. antibiotics,e. tetanus prophylaxis,,,,,,key: the key is b. wide splint with upward position. [if the limb is kept hanging it will aggravate the swelling as fluid shifts to dependant part. here wide splint with upward position will help the accumulated blood or fluid to move down and will improve the swelling].,"The best treatment option for a young man whose arm is very swollen after being caught in a machine is a wide splint with upward position (option b). Keeping the limb hanging could worsen the swelling as fluid shifts to the dependent part, whereas a wide splint with upward position helps the accumulated blood or fluid to move down and improve the swelling. A plaster cast (option a) is not appropriate since there is no fracture seen on the X-ray, and antibiotics (option d) are not necessary unless there is an infection. Analgesics (option c) may help manage pain but do not address the swelling directly. Tetanus prophylaxis (option e) should always be considered in cases of injury, but it does not address the swelling or help with the immediate treatment of the injury. Therefore, option b is the most appropriate answer in this case.",b,b,TRUE,

[both digoxin and amitryptiline can cause extrasystole].,"The correct answer to this question is a) digoxin, which is a medication commonly used to treat heart failure. Digoxin works by slowing down the heart rate and increasing the strength of each heartbeat. However, it can also cause side effects such as extrasystole, where an extra heartbeat occurs outside of the normal rhythm. Amitriptyline, choice b, is an antidepressant medication and not typically associated with extrasystole. Atenolol, choice c, is a beta blocker used to lower blood pressure and is not known to cause extrasystole. Ramipril, choice d, is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure but is also not associated with extrasystole. Bendroflumethiazide, choice e, is a diuretic used to treat high blood pressure and edema and would not cause extrasystole. Therefore, choice a is the correct answer given the presentation of the child's ECG and the mechanism of action and side effects of digoxin.",a,a,TRUE,

[incubation period of malaria is 7 – 30 days. malaria prophylaxis cannot give confirmed protection and there is often failure of prophylaxis. fever, vomiting, neck stiffness are consistent with cerebral malaria].","Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 5-year-old child with fever, vomiting, and neck stiffness who had recently traveled to Ghana would be cerebral malaria (answer b). This is because the incubation period for malaria ranges from 7-30 days, which would fit with the timeframe of the child's symptoms occurring 6 weeks after their travel. Additionally, while prophylaxis may lessen the risk of infection, it is not a guaranteed protection and there can be failures. Fever, vomiting, and neck stiffness can also be consistent with cerebral malaria, which affects the brain and can lead to seizures, coma, and other serious complications. The other choices, including cerebral abscess, meningococcal meningitis, SAH, cerebral tumor, and pneumonia, would each have different characteristic symptoms, causes, and risk factors that do not align with the information provided in this case. Therefore, based on the child's recent travel history and symptom presentation, cerebral malaria is the most likely explanation for their condition.",b,b,TRUE,

[bendroflumethiazide causes hyponatremia and hypokalemia. but the findings are opposite which is probably error of test. hence blood test should be repeated to confirm the level of potassium and sodium].,"The correct answer is E, repeat the blood test. The patient is currently on bendroflumethiazide, which can cause hyponatremia and hypokalemia. However, the lab results show the potassium level is actually high and the sodium level is within normal range. This opposite finding could be due to an error in the test, therefore repeating the blood test is necessary to confirm the levels of potassium and sodium. Options A (stop meds), B (continue same dose), C (increase dose) and D (decrease dose) are incorrect as they are not necessary based on the given information. It is important to first confirm the accuracy of the lab results before any changes in medication are made.",e,e,TRUE,

[pancoast tumour is the apical lung cancer that is associated with destructive lesions of the thoracic inlet and involvement of the brachial plexus and cervical sympathetic nerves (the stellate ganglion) leading to horner’s syndrome].,"Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for the 65-year-old man would be a Pancoast tumor. This is because of the presence of multiple symptoms such as significant weight loss, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain. Furthermore, the exam reveals a constricted left pupil and drooping of the left eyelid, indicating Horner’s Syndrome which is associated with apical lung cancers like a Pancoast tumor. Thoracic outlet syndrome and cervical rib may also present with similar symptoms, but the presence of Horner's Syndrome helps to rule them out as possible diagnoses. Pneumonia and bronchogenic carcinoma can also cause similar symptoms, but the presence of Horner's Syndrome makes them less likely to be the correct answer. Therefore, based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is a Pancoast tumor.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the patient fulfilled three Centor criteria, indicating the use of antibiotics. Antipyretic analgesics, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, are also recommended. Tonsillectomy is indicated if the child has five or more episodes of acute sore throat per year, if symptoms have been present for at least a year, or if the episodes of sore throat disrupt the child's normal behavior or day-to-day functioning.

According to patient.info, stones less than 5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously in up to 80% of people, and two-thirds of stones that pass spontaneously will do so within four weeks of onset of symptoms. Since the patient has already passed a 4mm stone, there is a good chance they will pass the 3mm stone on their own within four weeks. Option A, ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy), is used to break up stones, but is not necessary in this case since the stone may pass on its own. Option C, dormier basket, and option D, surgery, are both invasive procedures used to remove stones that cannot be passed on their own or cause obstruction or infection, none of which apply to this case. Option E, PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy), is a more invasive procedure used for larger stones and is not appropriate in this case. Therefore, the best management for this patient is to monitor and wait for the stone to pass spontaneously.",b,b,TRUE,

The presence of these symptoms in conjunction with a history of upper respiratory tract infection strongly suggests acute otitis media. The other answer choices can be ruled out based on specific clinical findings. Otitis externa (a) typically presents with pain on manipulation of the pinna and itching in the ear canal, while serous otitis media (c) does not present with fever or earache, but rather with decreased hearing and a sense of fullness in the ear. Chronic suppurative otitis media (d) presents with intermittent draining from the ear, and mastoiditis (e) presents with pain and redness behind the ear. Therefore, the correct answer is b, acute otitis media.",b,b,TRUE,

Bell's Palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles on one side of the face. It is often accompanied by pain or numbness around the ear. This condition is caused by damage or inflammation of the facial nerve, and is not related to a stroke or a subdural hemorrhage. Similarly, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) also known as mini-stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) do not present with sudden facial weakness and numbness. Therefore, Bell's Palsy is the most appropriate diagnosis for the 3-year-old girl's symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because a greenstick fracture is a partial fracture in which one side of the bone is broken while the other side is bent. It is commonly seen in children due to their growing bones and softer bone structure. The fact that there is minimal tenderness on exam and no sign of deformity or swelling further supports this diagnosis as these are common characteristics of a greenstick fracture. The other choices can be ruled out because they do not align with the symptoms and exam findings described in the question. A mid-radius or mid-ulnar fracture would likely have more tenderness and swelling, while a neck or shaft of humerus fracture would present with greater limitation in range of motion and pain with movement.",e,e,TRUE,

[there is asbestos exposure in builders and associated smoking greatly increases the possibility of developing mesothelioma and the given presentations are typical of mesothelioma. best investigation is pleural biopsy].,"The correct answer is D, pleural biopsy. This is because the patient's medical history of asbestos exposure in builders combined with smoking greatly increases the likelihood of developing mesothelioma, and the patient's symptoms and radiological findings are typical of this condition. A pleural biopsy can provide definitive diagnosis by allowing for the examination of tissue samples for the presence of cancerous cells. Choice A, CXR, may not be accurate enough to make a definitive diagnosis and may miss small tumors. Choice B, pleural fluid aspiration of cytology, may not provide enough tissue for analysis. Choice C, MRI, may show structural changes but is less sensitive than other imaging modalities. Choice E, CT, which is a commonly used modality for the evaluation of mesothelioma, can inform further diagnosis but may not be the most specific and is unlikely to provide a definitive diagnosis without concomitant biopsy.",d,d,TRUE,

[likely diagnosis is pneumothorax. so investigation of choice is cxr].,"In the scenario presented, the most appropriate investigation of choice would be a chest X-ray (CXR) - answer A. The likely diagnosis in this case is pneumothorax, which is a condition that occurs when air enters the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs and causes a collapse of the lung. A CXR is the most commonly used imaging modality to evaluate for pneumothorax and can reliably confirm the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans, and CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) are not typically used for the initial evaluation of a suspected pneumothorax. CT and MRI may be used in certain cases to evaluate for complications or underlying causes of pneumothorax. V/Q scans and CTPA are more commonly used to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, which is a different condition with different presenting symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

This investigation will allow for the documentation of low blood pressure as the cause of the presenting symptom. The case seems to be one of postural hypotension and low blood pressure as a result of the given anti-hypertensive medication. The other options, such as ECG, MRI, CXR, and CT scan, are less relevant to the presenting symptom and do not specifically address the issue of blood pressure regulation. Therefore, the most appropriate investigation in this case is ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.",a,a,TRUE,

[a case of 3rd nerve palsy. so to delineate the cause ct should be done].,"The correct answer for the most appropriate investigation for a 33yo female who complains of diplopia on upright gaze and presents with ptosis is option D - CT. This is because these symptoms suggest a case of 3rd nerve palsy, a condition that can be caused by various underlying conditions that can only be identified through a CT scan. Choice A - ophthalmoscopy, is an eye exam that is not sensitive enough to detect the cause of a 3rd nerve palsy. Choice B - visual field test, is a test used to detect abnormal vision, but it is not useful in this scenario. Choice C - TFT, stands for thyroid function test, which is unnecessary in this case, as there are no indications that the patient has any thyroid abnormalities. Option E - checking red reflex, is also not useful in this case, as it is a test used to detect cataracts in infants, not 3rd nerve palsies in adults. In conclusion, a CT scan is the most appropriate investigation to identify the cause of the 3rd nerve palsy presented by the patient in this scenario.",d,d,TRUE,

The patient's blue and purple face is most likely due to a catch up of breath rather than cyanosis of pneumothorax, which takes time to develop. As there are no immediate diagnostic features mentioned, ABC treatment for collapse in sport's trauma should be followed, which includes administering oxygen as the first treatment modality. Oxygen helps absorb air from the pleural space and speeds up the absorption of air. Clinical ground diagnosis should then be made, followed by needle aspiration if necessary. Inserting a needle in the 2nd or 5th ICS or intubating the patient is not recommended without a proper diagnosis. Starting CPR is also not necessary at this point.",e,e,TRUE,

The valgus test involves an attempt to force the leg at the knee into valgus with an abducting force applied to the foot. If the knee opens up on the medial side, it indicates damage to the MCL. This injury is common in cases of direct impact or injury to the lateral aspect of the knee. The other choices such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and meniscus, are not likely to be injured based on the given information and the results of the valgus test. Therefore, the correct answer is option B, MCL.",b,b,TRUE,
"941. a 75yo man comes in complaining of difficulty in passing urine, poor stream and dribbling at the end of voiding and anorexia. us shows bilateral hydronephrosis. what is the cause of these findings?",a. bph,b. renal stones,c. bladder stones,d. prostatic ca,e. uti,,,,,,"key: the key is d. prostatic ca. [elderly patient of 75yrs with obstructive symptoms of lower urinary tract, bilateral hydronephrosis all can occur in bph or ca prostate. anorexia is clincher here. it is a feature of carcinoma rather than bph].","The correct answer is d. prostatic ca. The patient's symptoms of difficulty in passing urine, poor stream, and dribbling at the end of voiding, along with bilateral hydronephrosis, can occur in both BPH and prostate cancer. However, the presence of anorexia is a clincher here, as it is a feature of carcinoma rather than BPH. The other answer choices, renal stones, bladder stones, and UTI, can possibly cause obstructive symptoms but are less likely to result in bilateral hydronephrosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings in a 75-year-old patient is prostatic carcinoma.",d,d,TRUE,
"942. 2h after an appendectomy, a pt complains of a rapid hr and fever. he says there is also abdominal pain and pain in the shoulder area. what is happening to this pt?",a. intra-abdominal bleeding,b. anastomotic leak,c. sepsis,d. intestinal obstruction,,,,,,,key: the key is a. intra-abdominal bleeding.,"The correct answer is A, intra-abdominal bleeding. This is likely due to a ruptured blood vessel during the appendectomy surgery. The symptoms of a rapid heart rate, fever, abdominal pain, and pain in the shoulder area are all indicative of internal bleeding. Option B, anastomotic leak, is less likely as it would present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Option C, sepsis, can occur as a complication of intra-abdominal bleeding but is not the primary issue in this scenario. Option D, intestinal obstruction, is also less likely as the symptoms do not match up with this condition. Overall, the rapid onset of symptoms make intra-abdominal bleeding the most likely cause of the patient's discomfort. It is important for the patient to seek medical attention immediately to prevent further complications.",a,a,TRUE,
943.  a 50yo man presents with the complaints of recurrent uti and occasional blood in the urine. some unusual cells have been seen in urine on routine exam. which of the following inv would you like to carry out now?,a. cystoscopy,b. urine c&s,c. xr kub,d. us,e. cbc,,,,,,key: the key is d. us. it is wrong key! correct key is a. cystoscopy. [likely diagnosis is bladder cancer. occasional blood in urine and unusual cells (suggestive of malignant cells) suggests the diagnosis. it is also true that in bladder cancer there occurs frequent uti like symptoms].,"The correct answer is A, cystoscopy. The presentation of a 50-year-old man with recurrent UTIs and occasional blood in urine, along with the presence of unusual cells in urine on routine exam, suggests a likely diagnosis of bladder cancer. Cystoscopy would allow for direct visualization of the bladder, potentially confirming the diagnosis of bladder cancer and providing information about the extent of the disease. Urine culture and sensitivity (C&S) and CBC are not specific or sensitive enough for diagnosing bladder cancer. X-ray KUB and ultrasound (US) studies do not provide adequate views of the bladder. Therefore, cystoscopy is the most appropriate next step in investigating this patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,
944. a 28yo drug user presents to ed collapsed and anuria. his serum k+=7.5mmol/l. cxr shows early pulmonary edema. what is the next appropriate management for this pt?,a. urgent hemodialysis,b. iv calcium gluconate,c. iv insulin + dextrose,d. furosemide,e. iv 0.9% ns,,,,,,key: the key is b. iv calcium gluconate. [in severe hyperkalemia iv calcium gluconate is given to protect the heart from cardiac arrest or life-threatening arrhythmias till definitive treatments are arranged].,"The correct answer is b. IV calcium gluconate. In severe hyperkalemia, high levels of potassium in the blood can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, and IV calcium gluconate is given to protect the heart until definitive treatments can be arranged. In this case, the patient's high serum potassium level and early pulmonary edema indicate severe hyperkalemia, and IV calcium gluconate is the appropriate initial management to prevent cardiac complications. Urgent hemodialysis (choice a) may eventually be necessary to remove excess potassium from the bloodstream, but it is not the initial recommendation in this case. IV insulin and dextrose (choice c) and furosemide (choice d) may help remove excess potassium, but they do not protect the heart from arrhythmias. IV 0.9% NaCl (choice e) is not indicated for this patient's condition. Therefore, the most appropriate initial management for this patient is IV calcium gluconate to protect his heart from life-threatening arrhythmias.",b,b,TRUE,
"945.  dm man feels hot, painful lump near the anal region. what is the most probable dx?",a. anal fissure,b. abscess,c. hematoma,d. wart,e. external hemorrhoids,,,,,,key: the key is b. abscess. [dm patients are much prone to infection].,"The most probable diagnosis for a diabetic man who feels a hot, painful lump near the anal region is an abscess, which is represented by the key b. This is because diabetic patients are more prone to infections, and an abscess is a common bacterial infection that can occur in the anal gland due to a blockage or inflammation of the gland. An anal fissure, hematoma, wart, or external hemorrhoids are less likely diagnoses because they do not match the given symptoms of a hot, painful lump. An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anal canal, a hematoma is a collection of blood outside the blood vessels, a wart is a viral infection that appears as a small, raised bump, and external hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the lower rectum or anus. Therefore, the correct answer is b, abscess.",b,b,TRUE,
946. a 65yo lady with t1dm for the last 20y comes with a tender lump near the anal opening. she says she also has a fever. what tx should she get?,a. i&d + antibiotics,b. iv antibiotics,c. c&s of aspirate from swelling,d. painkillers,e. cautery of swelling,,,,,,key: the key is a. i&d + antibiotics. [d/d 1. perianal abscess 2. perianal hematoma 3. thrombosed piles. as infection is common in dm likely case is perianal abscess].,"This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with a perianal abscess, which is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the recommended treatment for this patient is i&d (incision and drainage) along with antibiotics. Choice b, iv antibiotics, may be used if the patient is unable to tolerate oral antibiotics or if the abscess is more severe. Choice c, c&s of aspirate from swelling, may be used to confirm the presence of an abscess, but treatment with i&d and antibiotics should not be delayed while waiting for the results. Choices d and e, painkillers and cautery of swelling, are not recommended treatments for a perianal abscess and would not address the underlying infection. Therefore, the correct answer is a. i&d + antibiotics.",a,a,TRUE,

[this is cellulitis which may progress to gangrene in a diabetic].,"The correct answer is d. Gangrene, as this patient has symptoms consistent with cellulitis, which may progress to gangrene in diabetic patients. Meningitis and sepsis are not likely complications of this condition. An ulcer may also occur in diabetic patients but is not the most likely complication in this case. It is important to address this patient's symptoms promptly to prevent the progression to gangrene and potentially limb amputation. Immediate treatment with antibiotics and management of diabetes is necessary.",d,d,TRUE,
948. after surgery a pt’s left leg has become swollen and tender. the diameter of the calf has increased and passive movements cause pain. what is the most probable dx?,a. dvt,b. lymphedema,c. peripheral vascular disease,d. hematoma,e. superficial thrombophlebitis,,,,,,"key: the key is a. dvt. [swelling, tenderness and enlarged calf diameter are features of dvt supported by positive homan’s test (pain on passive movement)].","The most probable diagnosis for the patient experiencing swelling, tenderness, and an enlarged calf diameter along with pain on passive movement after surgery is deep vein thrombosis (DVT) supported by a positive Homan’s test. DVT is a serious condition that involves the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, typically in the leg. The other choices, such as lymphedema, peripheral vascular disease, hematoma, or superficial thrombophlebitis, do not present with all of the characteristic symptoms of DVT. Lymphedema involves the accumulation of fluid in the tissues, while peripheral vascular disease affects circulation in the extremities. Hematoma is a collection of blood outside a blood vessel, and superficial thrombophlebitis affects the veins near the skin’s surface. Therefore, based on the patient’s symptoms, DVT is the most probable diagnosis, and the other choices are unlikely.",a,a,TRUE,
"949. 2h after an appendectomy, a pt complains of a rapid hr and fever. he says there is also abdominal pain and pain in the shoulder area. what is the first step in the management?",a. maintain iv access and give iv fluids,b. start iv antibiotics,c. insert ngt for intestinal decompression,d. cross match blood,e. emergency exploratory laparotomy,,,,,,key: the key is a. maintain iv access and give iv fluids. [probable leakage from stump. first step is maintain iv access and give iv fluid].,"The correct answer to this question is a. The patient's symptoms suggest the possibility of a postoperative complication, such as an infection or bleeding. The first step in management should be to maintain IV access and give IV fluids, as this will help support the patient's cardiovascular system and stabilize their vital signs. Starting IV antibiotics (b) may be necessary if an infection is suspected, but it is not the immediate first step. Inserting an NGT for intestinal decompression (c) would not be appropriate in this case, as it does not address the patient's other symptoms. Cross-matching blood (d) or performing an emergency exploratory laparotomy (e) would be premature without further diagnostic workup to confirm the presence of bleeding or another surgical emergency. Therefore, the correct answer is a, as it addresses the patient's immediate needs and allows for further evaluation and treatment as necessary.",a,a,TRUE,
950. a pregnant woman presents with knee pain on movements. the pain becomes worse at the end of the day. radiology shows decreased joint space. labs: crp=12. what is the 1st line med?,a. paracetamol,b. nsaids,c. oral steroid,d. intra articular steroid,e. dmards,,,,,,"key: the key is a. paracetamol. [pain on movement, pain worse at end of day and decreased joint space are characteristic of osteoarthritis supported by no significant raise in inflammatory marker (crp=12). 1st line medicine is paracetamol].","The correct answer is a. paracetamol as the patient's symptoms and radiological findings are characteristic of osteoarthritis. The fact that there is no significant raise in the inflammatory marker (CRP=12) suggests that the pain is more likely due to mechanical rather than inflammatory causes. Therefore, NSAIDs and steroids, both of which have anti-inflammatory properties, would not be the first line of treatment. DMARDs are typically used for inflammatory arthritis and are not indicated in osteoarthritis. Intra-articular steroids may be considered in certain cases, but are not first-line treatment. Paracetamol is recommended as the initial therapy for mild to moderate osteoarthritis, as it can help with pain relief and is generally well-tolerated.",a,a,TRUE,

[proxymal myopathy (not able to climb stairs), mild breathlessness (involvement of thoracic muscles or interstitial lung disease), dysphagia due to involvement of the oropharyngeal striated muscles and upper oesophagus)and raised ck suggests the diagnosis of polymyositis].","Based on the given symptoms and lab results, the most likely diagnosis for this 68-year-old man is polymyositis. The weakness in the proximal muscles, difficulty in climbing stairs, and dysphagia suggest involvement of the oropharyngeal striated muscles and upper esophagus. The mild breathlessness could be due to the involvement of thoracic muscles or interstitial lung disease. The raised CK level also supports the diagnosis of polymyositis, as elevated CK is a common feature of this condition. Polymyalgia rheumatica and osteoarthritis do not typically present with muscle weakness, while muscular dystrophy usually presents earlier in life. Esophageal carcinoma may cause dysphagia, but it is not associated with muscle weakness. Therefore, the correct answer is a. polymyositis, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and lab results.",a,a,TRUE,
952. a 67yo builder presents with a persistent nodular lesion on upper part of pinna with some telangiectasia around the lesion. what is the dx?,a. basal cell,b. squamous cell,c. keratocanthoma,d. actinic keratosis,e. bowens disease,,,,,,key: the key is a. basal cell ca. [any ulcer which is located above the neck is always basal cell carcinoma until proven otherwise. source: samson notes].,"The correct answer is a. basal cell carcinoma. This is because any ulcer which is located above the neck is always assumed to be basal cell carcinoma until proven otherwise. The persistent nodular lesion on the upper part of the pinna with telangiectasia around the lesion is a common characteristic of basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis may also present with nodular lesions, but they typically have a scaly or crusted appearance and may be more widespread. Keratocanthoma and Bowen's disease are less common than basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas and typically present with unique clinical features. Overall, the presentation of a persistent nodular lesion on the upper part of the pinna with telangiectasia around the lesion strongly suggests basal cell carcinoma.",a,a,TRUE,

Alteplase is not the correct choice as the window period for administering it is only 4.5 hours, and if we cannot establish this period, we cannot proceed with giving it. Warfarin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole are not appropriate treatments for this patient as they are used for prevention in patients at risk of stroke, and not for immediate treatment of a stroke. Therefore, aspirin is the most appropriate choice for this patient at this time.",a,a,TRUE,
"954. a 73yo man who is recovering from surgery on the left carotid artery in his neck. he has slurred speech. on protusion of his tongue, the tip deviated to the left. what is the single most appropriate option?",a. accessory nerve,b. facial nerve,c. glossopharyngeal nerve,d. hypoglossal nerve,e. vagus nerve,,,,,,"key: the key is d. hypoglossal nerve. [testing function of the nerve is performed by asked the subject to stick their tongue straight out. if there is a loss of innervation to one side, the tongue will curve toward the affected side, due to unopposed action of the opposite genioglossus muscle. if this is the result of alower motor neuron lesion, the tongue will be curved toward the damaged side, combined with the presence of fasciculations or atrophy. however, if the deficit is caused by an upper motor neuron lesion, the tongue will be curved away from the side of the cortical damage, without the presence of fasciculations or atrophy].","Based on the provided scenario, the correct answer is d. hypoglossal nerve. The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the tongue. In this case, the patient's slurred speech and deviation of the tongue to the left indicate a loss of innervation to one side, which can be caused by a lower or upper motor neuron lesion. The absence of fasciculations or atrophy suggests an upper motor neuron lesion, leading to the tongue curving away from the side of cortical damage. The other answer options, such as the accessory nerve, facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and vagus nerve, are not responsible for controlling the muscles of the tongue and would not be the most appropriate option for this patient's symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,

This occurs in panic attacks due to hyperventilation, which leads to the washout of CO2 and a resulting increase in pH to above 7.45, as seen in the patient's ABG of 7.52. The low pCO2 reading of 2.2kPa is also indicative of this condition, as is the compensatory decrease in bicarbonate (HCO3-) to 20meq/L. The other answer choices are incorrect as they do not match the ABG findings or the patient's condition.",b,b,TRUE,
"956. a 65yo man on dexamethasone underwent surgery. during and after the surgery, his blood glucose was around 17-19mmol/l. what will you give the pt?",a. insulin,b. oral hypoglycemic,c. remove dexamethasone,d. iv saline,e. ix dextrose,,,,,,"key: the key is d. iv saline. [it is estimated that adults secrete 75-150mg of cortisol in response to major surgery and 50mg a day for minor surgery, and secretion parallels duration and extent of surgery patients undergoing a surgical procedure or responding to stress, trauma, or an acute illness will exhibit an increase in adrenal cortisol production up to 6-fold normal levels. however, in patients on chronic exogenous steroid therapy, atrophy of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis may occur through feedback inhibition, leading to an inability to respond to stress. it has historically been believed that patients receiving long-term corticosteroids require supplemental, perioperative doses, and that failure to provide such coverage in secondary adrenal insufficiency may lead to an adrenal crisis characterized by hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. *** so who are telling remove dexamethason are wrong!!!*** patients receiving “physiologic replacement” doses (<10 mg/ day) do not need additional steroids perioperatively beyond their standard regimen. patients receiving doses exceeding the normal expected stress response for their surgery (>150 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for moderate/major surgery, or >50 mg/ day of hydrocortisone equivalent for minor surgery) also do not need additional coverage beyond their current therapy, because acute immunosuppressive doses are more than sufficient to maintain cardiovascular stability during the operation. regular daily dose of more than 10 mg prednisolone within the last three months: i)	minor surgery:		25 mg hydrocortisone at induction ii)	moderate surgery		usual pre-operative steroids (hysterectomy)		+ 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction + 100 mg hydrocortisone/day  iii)	major surgery		usual pre-operative steroids major trauma, prolonged 	+ 25 mg hydrocortisone at induction surgery 			+ 100 mg hydrocortisone/day for 2 – 3 days  surgical patients commonly develop hyperglycemia related to the hypermetabolic stress response, which increases glucose production and causes insulin resistance. although hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes, the treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin infusions has not provided consistent benefits. despite early results, which suggested decreased mortality and other advantages of “tight” glucose control, later investigations found no benefit or increased mortality when hyperglycemia was aggressively treated with insulin. because of these conflicting data, the optimal glucose concentration to improve outcomes in critically ill patients is unknown. there is agreement, however, that hypoglycemia is an undesirable complication of intensive insulin therapy and should be avoided. so, “for perioperative hyperglycemia no need of insulin” just iv saline!!!].","The correct answer is d. IV saline. Perioperative hyperglycemia is a common occurrence in surgical patients, and it is related to the hypermetabolic stress response. Insulin treatment for perioperative hyperglycemia has not been consistently beneficial, and hypoglycemia is an undesirable complication of intensive insulin therapy. Therefore, the recommended treatment for perioperative hyperglycemia is IV saline. Removing the dexamethasone is not necessary, as patients receiving doses exceeding the expected stress response for their surgery do not need additional coverage beyond their current therapy. The use of oral hypoglycemic agents is not recommended for the management of hyperglycemia in the perioperative setting. Finally, administering dextrose would further increase the patient's blood glucose levels and worsen his hyperglycemia.",d,d,TRUE,

While DMARDs are not painkillers, they can prevent disease progression in the long term. Paracetamol may not be sufficient to control severe pain, and co-codamol can cause constipation, which the patient is already taking a laxative for. Therefore, excluding other options, ibuprofen seems to be the best option.

The dull greyish tympanic membrane and absence of the shadow of the handle of malleus on examination indicate the presence of fluid in the middle ear. This is a characteristic feature of Secretory OM, which is also known as Otitis media with effusion (OME). Chronic OM (A) is characterized by the presence of permanent perforation of the tympanic membrane and discharge from the ear. Acute OM (B) is characterized by a painful ear with fever and the presence of purulent discharge from the middle ear. Otitis externa (D) is an infection of the external ear canal and is characterized by pain, itching, and discharge from the ear. Cholesteatoma (E) is a rare condition characterized by the growth of skin tissue inside the middle ear, which can cause hearing loss, dizziness, and facial paralysis. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is Secretory OM because it is consistent with the clinical presentation and examination findings.",c,c,TRUE,

SAD is a type of complex phobia that can severely affect a person's confidence and self-esteem, interfere with relationships, and impair performance at work or school. Agoraphobia is characterized by the fear of open or public spaces, while PTSD is often associated with a traumatic experience. OCD involves obsessive and compulsive behavior patterns, while GAD is marked by excessive worry and anxiety about various events or activities. Therefore, based on the woman's symptoms, SAD is the most likely explanation for her behavior, as it is consistent with her fear of social interaction and criticism from others.",c,c,TRUE,

In this scenario, the perforated ulcer would cause the stomach contents and blood to leak into the abdominal cavity. Due to gravity, the fluid would accumulate under the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities. Option a, the left paracolic gutter, is incorrect because it is located on the left side of the abdominal cavity, and this scenario involves bleeding from the gastro-duodenal artery, which is not near the left paracolic gutter. Option b, the pelvic cavity, is incorrect because the bleeding is not originating from the pelvic region. Option c, the first part of the duodenum, is incorrect because this area is not near the perforation site and would not accumulate fluid from the bleeding. Option e, retroperitoneal, is incorrect because this refers to an area outside of the abdominal cavity and would not accumulate fluid from the bleeding.",d,d,TRUE,

The presenting symptoms, family history, and coagulation test results are consistent with this diagnosis. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder that causes deficiency in clotting factor VIII, leading to spontaneous, prolonged bleeding episodes. The prolonged aptt and decreased factor VIII levels in this patient are classic findings in hemophilia A. Hemophilia B, von Willebrand’s disease, ITP, and TTP are all potential differential diagnoses for a patient with bleeding symptoms, but the given clinical presentation and laboratory results make hemophilia A the most likely diagnosis. Hemophilia B causes deficiency in clotting factor IX, while von Willebrand’s disease involves a deficiency in von Willebrand factor.

This patient is postmenopausal and has recently had a myocardial infarction (MI), making hormonal therapy with raloxifene or estrogen absolutely contraindicated due to their increased risk of cardiovascular events. The use of evening primrose has not been shown to effectively manage hot flashes and night sweats. The initial answer of c, cocp, is also incorrect as combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) are also absolutely contraindicated in patients with recent MI. Therefore, clonidine, a non-hormonal pharmacological option, is the most appropriate management for this patient's symptoms.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because the presence of a mass in the mediastinum along with hoarseness of voice and cough can indicate the possibility of lung cancer. Lymph nodes in the mediastinum can be affected by lung cancer tumors and thus a biopsy of these nodes can help confirm the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, and CT thorax can also be useful in the investigation of lung cancer, but a lymph node biopsy is the most direct way to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound (US) may also be used to guide the biopsy procedure. Therefore, the best choice for confirming the diagnosis is lymph node biopsy.",e,e,TRUE,

Percutaneous nephrostomy. This patient presents with an 8mm stone in the left lower ureter causing obstructive uropathy, which was initially treated with nifedipine and steroids. However, his symptoms worsened and he passed two stones with impending acute renal failure. In this case, percutaneous nephrostomy is the best management option. This procedure involves placing a catheter into the renal collecting system to relieve pressure and improve kidney function. Option a to continue the same treatment is not appropriate given the worsening symptoms and impending renal failure. Option b to start alpha-blockers can help relax the ureter and facilitate stone passage, but is less likely to be effective with larger stones. Option c, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is not appropriate for larger stones, as they may not break up completely and cause further obstruction. Option d, percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a surgical option reserved for larger stones that cannot be managed with less invasive procedures. Option f, open surgery, is rarely indicated for this type of stone. Thus, the correct answer is e, percutaneous nephrostomy.",e,e,TRUE,

"966. a young girl presented to obgyn assessment unit with lower abdominal pain and per vaginal bleeding after a hx of hysterosalpingograph as a part of her infertility tx. observation: bp=90/50mmhg, pulse=120bpm, exam revealed rigid abdomen. what is the most appropriate next inv?",a. ct,b. xr erect and supine,c. us abdomen,d. coag profile,e. cxr,,,,,,key: the key is c. us abdomen. [likely cause of bleeding and shock is ruptured fallopian tube for which appropriate next investigation is us abdomen].,"Based on the presented information, the most appropriate next investigation is an ultrasound of the abdomen. The likely cause of the bleeding and shock is a ruptured fallopian tube, which can be diagnosed using an ultrasound. A CT scan or chest x-ray would not provide useful information for this particular presentation. Coagulation profile may be useful in determining the cause of bleeding, but it would not assist in the diagnosis of a ruptured fallopian tube. Therefore, choice d is incorrect. In conclusion, an ultrasound of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step.",c,c,TRUE,
967. a 21yo woman who is on cocp had to take azithromycin. what should be advised for her contraception?,a. using 7d condoms after antibiotics and avoid pill free break,b. using 14d condoms after antibiotics and avoid pill free break,c. using 7d condoms after antibiotics,d. no extra precaution,e. using 14d condoms after antibiotics,,,,,,key: the key is d. no extra precaution. [before it was thought that antibiotics like azithromycin inhibits the enzyme and reduce the efficacy of cocp. but later it was established that practically no significant changes occur and so no need of any extra precaution].,"The correct answer to this question is d. No extra precaution is needed. Although it was once thought that antibiotics like azithromycin could inhibit the enzyme and reduce the efficacy of cocp, further studies have shown that there are practically no significant changes that occur in this regard. Thus, there is no need for any extra precautionary measures such as using condoms or avoiding pill free breaks. Choices a, b, c and e, which all involve using condoms for a period of time after taking antibiotics, are incorrect as they are unnecessary and could potentially lead to unwanted and unnecessary use of contraceptives. The best advice for this situation would be to continue using the cocp as usual without any additional precautions.",d,d,TRUE,
968. a 60yo woman presented with radial fx and had a colle’s fx and supracondylar fx in the past. what inv is req to detect her possibility of having the same prb later?,a. dexa scan,b. mri,c. nuclear bone scan,d. ct,e. bone biopsy,,,,,,key: the key is a. dexa scan. [the likely cause of these multiple fracture is osteoporosis (post menopausal women) for which we should do dexa scan to establish the diagnosis].,"The correct answer is a. Dexa scan. This is because the likely cause of these multiple fractures is osteoporosis, which is common in post-menopausal women. The dexa scan is a non-invasive test that can measure bone mineral density and identify the presence of osteoporosis. This test is important to establish the diagnosis of osteoporosis, which can provide the opportunity for the patient to receive appropriate treatment and prevent future fractures. MRI, nuclear bone scan, CT scan, and bone biopsy are not necessary for detecting osteoporosis, and may not be as effective as the dexa scan in identifying this condition.",a,a,TRUE,
"969. a 43yo woman presents with low mood, loss of libido, sleep disturbance, tiredness, palpitation, chest discomfort, irritability and recurrent worries. what is the most likely dx?",a. seasonal affective disorder,b. mod depression,c. dysthymia,d. gad,e. bipolar disorder,,,,,,key: the key is b. moderate depression. [mild depression: i)low mood ii) anhedonia iii) guilt iv) hopelessness v) worthlessness vi) inability to concentrate. tx cbt moderate depression: features of mild + vii) poor sleep viii) poor appetite ix) poor libido x) easy fatiguability. tx antidepressants severe depression: features of moderate + xi) suicidal intensions. tx ect].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 43-year-old woman presenting with low mood, loss of libido, sleep disturbance, tiredness, palpitation, chest discomfort, irritability, and recurrent worries is moderate depression (answer choice B). Moderate depression is characterized by the features of mild depression (low mood, anhedonia, guilt, hopelessness, worthlessness, and inability to concentrate) as well as poor sleep, poor appetite, poor libido, and easy fatigability. While seasonal affective disorder (answer choice A) and dysthymia (answer choice C) may present with similar symptoms, they do not have the severity of symptoms required for a diagnosis of moderate depression. Generalized anxiety disorder (answer choice D) primarily presents with excessive worry, rather than symptoms of depression. Bipolar disorder (answer choice E) may cause symptoms of depression as well as mania or hypomania, which are not evident in this patient's presentation. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is moderate depression.",b,b,TRUE,
970. which of the following is true for tamoxifen?,a. increased incidence of endometrial carcinoma,b. increased risk of breast ca,c. increased risk of osteoporosis,d. increased risk of ovarian ca,,,,,,,key: the key is a. increased incidence of endometrial carcinoma.,"The correct answer is a. Tamoxifen has been found to increase the incidence of endometrial carcinoma, a type of cancer that forms in the lining of the uterus. This is because tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue, but as an estrogen agonist in endometrial tissue, leading to hyperplasia and eventual carcinoma. Option b is incorrect as tamoxifen is actually used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk patients. Option c is also incorrect as tamoxifen has been shown to have a protective effect on bone density. Option d is not supported by current research, as studies have shown no significant increase in the risk of ovarian cancer with the use of tamoxifen.",a,a,TRUE,
971. a 45yo male complains of tremors in hands. exam: tremors are absent at rest but present when arms are held outstretched and persist on movement. what is the most probable dx?,a. parkinsonism,b. benign essential tremor,c. cerebellar disease,d. liver failure,e. stroke,,,,,,key: the key is b. benign essential tremor. [tremors absent at rest and present on outstretched hand and persist on movement are benign essential tremor].,"The most probable diagnosis for the 45-year-old male who complains of tremors in his hands is b. benign essential tremor. This is because the tremors are absent at rest, present when the arms are held outstretched, and persist on movement, which are characteristic features of benign essential tremor. Parkinsonism is not the most probable diagnosis because tremors in Parkinsonism are present at rest and get better during movement. Cerebellar disease may cause tremors, but other symptoms such as difficulties with coordination and balance would also be present. Liver failure and stroke are not typically associated with tremors. Therefore, based on the characteristics of the presenting symptoms, benign essential tremor is the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
972. pregnant lady had her antenatal screening for hiv and hep b. what more antenatal inf should she be screened for?,a. rubella and syphilis,b. toxoplasma and rubella,c. syphilis toxoplasma,d. hep c & e,e. hep a & c,,,,,,key: the key is a. rubella and syphilis.,"A pregnant woman should be screened for both rubella and syphilis in addition to HIV and Hepatitis B. The reason for this is that rubella and syphilis are both serious infections that can be transmitted from mother to fetus and can have severe consequences including birth defects and stillbirth. Toxoplasma and Hepatitis C and E are not typically included in routine antenatal screening unless there is specific concern or risk factors. Hepatitis A and C are also not typically screened for during pregnancy unless the woman is at increased risk for these infections. Therefore, the correct answer is a., rubella and syphilis.",a,a,TRUE,
"973. a young man has been found in the park, drunk and brought to the ed by ambulance. he recently lost his job and got divorced. he thinks nurses are plotting against him. what is the most likely dx?",a. schizoid personality,b. borderline personality,c. schizophrenia,d. psychotic depression,e. paranoid,,,,,,key: the key is e. paranoid personality disorder. [patients disease (paranoid personality disorder) is responsible for his  divorce and loss of job. suspiciousness to wife is reason for divorce].,"The correct answer for this scenario is e. Paranoid Personality Disorder. This is because the patient is exhibiting symptoms of suspicion and paranoid beliefs that others, in this case, nurses, are plotting against him. These symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for Paranoid Personality Disorder. Schizoid Personality Disorder (a) is characterized by social withdrawal, emotional detachment, and a limited range of emotional expression, which are not present in this scenario. Borderline Personality Disorder (b) is a disorder characterized by unstable moods, behavior, and relationships, and is not indicated by the presented symptoms. Schizophrenia (c) is a severe mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and behavior, which are not evident in the patient's presentation. Psychotic Depression (d) refers to Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features. However, the patient's primary symptoms are not related to depression, and therefore this diagnosis is not appropriate. In conclusion, Paranoid Personality Disorder is the most appropriate diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.",e,e,TRUE,
"974. an elderly man who used to work in the shipyard industry presented with cough and sob few weeks to months. he was given salbutamol nebulization and antibiotics and admitted to the ward. he died 3d later. ct: patchy infiltrates, pleural thickening and pleural effusion. why is this a coroner’s case?",a. pt got wrong dx or management,b. pt died soon after admission,c. death could be due to occupational illness,,,,,,,,key: the key is c. death could be due to occupational illness.,"This is a coroner's case because the elderly man presented with symptoms related to his previous occupation in the shipyard industry, and his CT scan showed evidence of patchy infiltrates, pleural thickening, and pleural effusion. The correct answer is c, as the possibility of the patient's death being due to an occupational illness is high considering his work history and the presence of pulmonary abnormalities on his CT scan. The other choices, a and b, do not seem applicable to this case as there is no evidence of misdiagnosis or inappropriate management, and the patient's death occurred soon after admission due to his underlying condition, which may have been exacerbated by his occupational exposures.",c,c,TRUE,
"975. a 26yo lady came with abdominal pain, vaginal discharge and low grade fever. what is the most likely dx?",a. hellp syndrome,b. acute pid,c. ectopic pregnancy,d. appendicitis,,,,,,,key: the key is b. acute pid.,"The most likely diagnosis for the 26-year-old lady experiencing abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and low-grade fever is acute PID or pelvic inflammatory disease. PID is an infection of the upper genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It commonly results from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. The symptoms of PID are similar to those of other pelvic conditions like an ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, and HELLP syndrome. However, the absence of acute severe pain, abnormal pregnancy, and liver enzyme abnormalities, respectively, makes the other choices less likely in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is acute PID, which could lead to long-term complications such as infertility if left untreated.",b,b,TRUE,
"976. a new screening test has been devised to detect early stages of prostate ca. however, the test tends to dx a lot of ppl with no cancer, although they do have cancer as dx by other standard tests. what is this flaw called?",a. false +ve,b. true +ve,c. false –ve,d. true –ve,e. poor specificity,,,,,,key: the key is c. false negative.,"The flaw described in the question is called a false negative, which is represented by option c. This means that the screening test fails to detect cancer in individuals who actually have the disease, even though other standard tests can diagnose them. False negative results can be dangerous as patients may not receive the necessary treatment, leading to further complications or even death. False positive (option a) refers to the opposite scenario, where the screening test indicates the presence of cancer in individuals who do not actually have the disease. True positive (option b) means the test correctly identifies those with cancer, while true negative (option d) means the test accurately excludes those without cancer. Poor specificity (option e) refers to a test which generates a high number of false positive results. Therefore, the best answer to the question is c, false negative, because the screening test fails to detect cancer in individuals who actually have it.",c,c,TRUE,
977. a 26yo political refugee has sought asylum in the uk and complains of poor conc. he keeps getting thoughts of his family whom he saw killed in a political coup. he is unable to sleep and feels hopeless about his survival. because of this he is afraid to go out. what is the most likely dx?,a. acute stress disorder,b. ptsd,c. social phobia,d. ocd,e. gad,,,,,,"key: the key is b. ptsd. [keep getting thoughts of his family disaster, insomnia, to avoid similar circumstances he is avoiding going out these are suggestive of ptsd].","The most likely diagnosis for the 26-year-old political refugee who has sought asylum in the UK and is experiencing poor concentration, intrusive thoughts of his family's death in a political coup, insomnia, hopelessness, and avoidance behavior is PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms presented align with the diagnostic criteria for PTSD which includes experiencing a traumatic event, intrusive thoughts or flashbacks related to the event, avoidance of triggers associated with the event, changes in mood or cognition, and changes in arousal or reactivity. Acute stress disorder may be considered as a potential diagnosis, but the symptoms presented have persisted for longer than a month, making PTSD a more likely diagnosis. The other options of social phobia, OCD, and GAD are not compatible with the symptoms presented.",b,b,TRUE,
978. a 2yo boy presented with gradual swelling of feet and poor feeding. he has gained weight and has dark urine. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. serum albumin (2nd),b. 24h urinary protein (1st),c. serum calcium,d. bue,e. serum glucose,,,,,,key: the key is b. 24 hr urinary protein. [a case of nephritic syndrome. so the single most appropriate investigation from the given options is 24 hour urinary protein].,"In a case of nephritic syndrome, where a 2-year-old boy presented with gradual swelling of feet and poor feeding, the single most appropriate investigation from the given options is 24-hour urinary protein (option b). This is because nephritic syndrome is characterized by increased protein in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli in the kidneys. The 24-hour urinary protein test measures the amount of protein excreted in the urine over a period of 24 hours and is a reliable indicator of renal function. Serum albumin (option a) is a test used to assess liver function and can also be decreased in nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by the loss of protein in urine. Serum calcium (option c) and serum glucose (option e) are unrelated to nephritic syndrome. BUE (option d) is not a relevant test in this scenario. Ultimately, the 24-hour urinary protein test is the most appropriate investigation to diagnose and monitor nephritic syndrome.",b,b,TRUE,
"979. a 26yo lady presents with high fever, lower abdominal pain and purulent vaginal discharge. she looks very unwell. what is the most appropriate management?",a. tetracycline 250mg qd,b. doxycycline 100mg bd and metronidazole 400mg bd,c. iv ceftriaxone 2g with doxycycline 100mg,d. iv ceftriaxone 2g with doxycycline 500mg,e. ofloxacin 400mg bd and metronidazole 400mg bd,,,,,,key: the key is c. iv ceftriaxone 2g with doxycycline 100mg. [the disease is severe needing inpatient management with iv ceftriaxone 2g + iv doxycycline 100 mg].,"The most appropriate management for a 26-year-old lady presenting with high fever, lower abdominal pain, and purulent vaginal discharge is option c, which is the administration of IV ceftriaxone 2g with doxycycline 100mg. This is because the given symptoms indicate a severe form of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) that needs inpatient care. Option a, tetracycline 250mg qd, and option e, ofloxacin 400mg bd and metronidazole 400mg bd, are not the preferred options for PID. Option b, doxycycline 100mg bd and metronidazole 400mg bd, may be appropriate for mild-to-moderate PID but may not be enough for severe cases. Option d, IV ceftriaxone 2g with doxycycline 500mg, may be excessive and has a higher risk of side effects. Therefore, option c provides the most effective treatment for severe PID and helps in preventing complications like infertility.",c,c,TRUE,
980. a 39wk pregnanct woman came to labor suite 3d after an obstructed labour presents with pain and swelling of one leg. exam: leg has blue mottling and is cold. what is the dx?,a. dvt,b. post phlebitis syndrome,c. embolus,d. varicose vein,e. herpes gladiatorum,,,,,,key: the key is c. embolus.,"The correct answer is c. embolus. The presenting symptoms of a swollen and painful leg with blue mottling and coldness suggest occlusion of a major blood vessel in the leg. This is consistent with an embolus, which is a blood clot or other debris that has detached from its site of origin and become lodged in a blood vessel, blocking blood flow. DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and post-phlebitis syndrome are both conditions that can cause blood clots in the leg, but they do not explain the sudden onset of severe symptoms and blue mottling. Varicose veins and herpes gladiatorum are unrelated to this presentation and can be ruled out. Therefore, the correct answer is c. embolus, which requires urgent medical attention to prevent serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.",c,c,TRUE,

[most secondary hemorrhage occurs due to infection which erodes a vessel. so patient should be admitted for iv antibiotics].,"In this case, the most appropriate management would be option A: admit for IV antibiotics. The patient is presenting with hemoptysis and fever, which suggests an infection may have developed in the area where the tonsils and adenoids were removed. Most secondary hemorrhage occurs due to infection eroding a vessel, so IV antibiotics would be the best course of action. Options B, C, D, and E are not recommended. Prescribing oral antibiotics and discharging the patient may not provide adequate treatment for the infection, while packing and reassurance are not sufficient treatments for the condition at hand. Surgery would not likely be necessary at this point in time. Therefore, the patient should be admitted for proper treatment and monitoring.",a,a,TRUE,
982. a 50yo female had swelling in her ankles. she is a known alcoholic. now she presented with breathlessness and palpitations. what is the most likely cause of her condition?,a. vt,b. svt,c. a-flutter,d. a-fib,e. v-ectopics,,,,,,key: the key is d. atrial fibrillation. [ankle swelling suggests alcoholic cardiomyopathy and alcoholism is also a well known cause of atrial fibrillation].,"The most likely cause of the 50-year-old female's condition, based on her history of alcohol abuse and current symptoms of breathlessness and palpitations, is atrial fibrillation (AF). Ankle swelling is often seen in cases of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which is a known risk factor for the development of AF. While ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial flutter, and ventricular ectopics can also cause similar symptoms, the presence of ankle swelling and alcoholism make AF the most likely cause. Therefore, option d, a-fib, is the correct answer. The other options are less likely causes and do not have a strong association with alcohol abuse and ankle swelling.",d,d,TRUE,
983. a young boy has acute scrotal pain for a few hours. exam: one testis is very painful to touch. he had this kind of pain before but it was mild and resolved itself within 30mins. what would you do next?,a. urgent exploration,b. us,c. antibiotics,d. iv fluids,e. doppler us,,,,,,key: the key is a. urgent exploration. [as sudden onset of severe pain likely diagnosis is torsion of testis. (infection takes a more prolonged course).  next step is urgent exploration].,"The correct answer is A, urgent exploration. This is because the sudden onset of severe pain in the testis is indicative of torsion of the testis, which is a urologic emergency. Infection takes a more prolonged course and usually does not present with sudden onset of severe pain. Urgent exploration is necessary in order to assess the viability of the testicle and to prevent permanent damage. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because they do not address the emergent nature of the situation. Urgent exploration is the most appropriate course of action in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,
984. an 8wk pregnant woman presents with persistent vomiting and weight loss. exam: hr=110bpm. dehydration was corrected with ns infusion and k+. the condition didn’t improve so im cyclizine was given. she is still vomiting. what is the next appropriate management?,a. iv fluids,b. iv antiemetics,c. iv steroids,d. terminate pregnancy,e. thiamine,,,,,,key: the key is c. iv steroid.  [steroids may be used in patient's of hyperemesis gravidarum refractory to standard therapy].,"The correct answer is C: IV steroids. In cases of hyperemesis gravidarum that are refractory to standard therapy, such as antiemetics and IV fluids, IV steroids may be used. In this particular case, the patient's persistent vomiting and weight loss despite treatment with cyclizine suggests that she is not responding to standard therapy and may benefit from IV steroids. IV fluids, while important for correcting dehydration, have already been administered and may not be the appropriate next step. IV antiemetics have already been tried without success. Terminating the pregnancy is not indicated unless there are severe complications or risks to the mother's health. Thiamine, while important for preventing Wernicke's encephalopathy in cases of persistent vomiting, is not the immediate next step in management. Therefore, IV steroids are the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's hyperemesis gravidarum.",c,c,TRUE,
985. a 28yo lady presents with dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea. she is very obese. she now wants reversible contraceptive method. which of the following will be most suitable for her?,a. mirena,b. cocp,c. pop,d. copper t,e. barrier method,,,,,,key: the key is a. mirena.,"The most suitable contraceptive for a 28-year-old obese woman who presents with dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea would be option A, Mirena. Mirena is an intrauterine device that releases a progestin hormone, which can help to reduce heavy bleeding during menstruation and provide relief from dysmenorrhea. It is also a long-term reversible contraceptive method, which is suitable for patients looking for a reliable form of contraception. The other options, such as COCP, POP, Copper T, or barrier method, may not be as effective in managing the patient's symptoms and may not provide sufficient contraceptive protection. Therefore, Mirena is considered the most suitable option for this patient based on her specific needs and medical history.",a,a,TRUE,

[antepartum hemorrhage. most important investigation to establish the dx is us].,"The correct answer to this question is a. ultrasound (us). Ultrasound is the most important investigation as it can help determine the cause of bleeding, such as placenta previa or placental abruption. CT is not preferred as it exposes the fetus to radiation and is not as accurate as ultrasound. D-dimer and clotting profile are also not necessary as bleeding is a common occurrence in pregnancy. Choosing none of the above options is not an appropriate response as a prompt diagnosis and treatment is necessary to prevent any harm to the mother and fetus. Therefore, ultrasound is the most appropriate investigation in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,
987. a 14yo girl presents with primary amenorrhea and a short stature. what is the most likely dx?,a. down’s syndrome,b. klinefeltner’s syndrome,c. turner’s syndrome,d. fragile x syndrome,e. normal finding,,,,,,key: the key is c. turner’s syndrome. [down’s syndrome and fragile x syndrome don’t have primary amenorrhea. klienfelters syndrome patients are tall males. so the likely diagnosis is turner’s syndrome].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 14-year-old girl presenting with primary amenorrhea and short stature is Turner's syndrome. Down's syndrome and fragile x syndrome do not typically present with primary amenorrhea, while Klinefelter's syndrome patients are tall males. Turner's syndrome is characterized by the absence or partial absence of one of the X chromosomes, leading to a variety of physical and developmental features such as heart defects, webbed neck, and delayed puberty. Therefore, the likely diagnosis is Turner's syndrome due to the combination of primary amenorrhea and short stature. The other options are not likely to be the cause of these specific symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
988. a 32yo woman wants reversible form of contraception. she has one child delivered by emergency c-section. she also suffers from migraine and heavy periods. what is the most suitable form of contraception for this lady?,a. cocp,b. mini pill,c. iucd,d. barrier method,e. abstinence,,,,,,key: the key is c. iucd. it is wrong key! correct key is b. mini pill.,"The correct answer for the most suitable form of contraception for a 32-year-old woman with a history of one child delivered by emergency c-section, migraine, and heavy periods is b. mini pill. This is because the mini pill is a progestogen-only contraceptive pill that contains no estrogen, which makes it an ideal choice for women with a history of migraine. It also helps to reduce heavy periods and does not increase the risk of blood clots, which is a concern for women who have a history of c-section. The other choices are not suitable for this woman because cocp or combined oral contraceptive pill contains estrogen, which can increase the risk of blood clots for women with a history of c-section, and IUCD or intrauterine contraceptive device may cause heavy bleeding, which is not suitable for this woman with heavy periods. Barrier method and abstinence are not as effective and reliable as hormonal methods of contraception, making them less ideal choices for this woman. Therefore, the most suitable form of contraception for this woman is the mini pill.",b,b,TRUE,

[in nephritic syndrome glomerulus is affected. so renal biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test].,"The correct answer for this question is option b, renal biopsy. In nephritic syndrome, the glomerulus is affected which causes the symptoms of hematuria, proteinuria, and edema. Renal biopsy is considered the definitive diagnostic test as it enables the examination of renal tissue under a microscope to determine the underlying cause of the nephritic syndrome. Options a, c, d, and e are not definitive diagnostic tests for nephritic syndrome but may be used to support the diagnosis or monitor the progression of the disease. Hence, renal biopsy is the most appropriate diagnostic test in this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,

[in chr. pyelonephritis us will demonstrate renal scarring and urinalysis will demonstrate pyuria which are absent here. in renal artery stenosis there will be considerable difference in kidney size from one another which is not found here. here likely diagnosis is gn].,"Based on the provided information, the most probable diagnosis for the 47-year-old man is a. glomerulonephritis (gn). The presence of proteinuria and hypertension supports the possibility of glomerular damage. The smooth renal pelvis and small kidney size suggest chronicity of the condition, ruling out unilateral renal artery stenosis. Additionally, there are no signs of pyelonephritis or myeloma as there is no evidence of renal scarring or pyuria, and there are no bone lesions or hypercalcemia, respectively. Acute renal failure (ARF) is also an unlikely possibility given the chronic nature of the kidney damage. Therefore, based on the presented symptoms, glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the result shows significant hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, which can be corrected by the administration of NS 0.9%. Although insulin can shift k+ in cells, this mild hyperkalemia does not require this treatment. Additionally, in lower blood glucose, insulin can cause hypoglycemia which should be avoided. Therefore, the best management option is NS 0.9% which will correct the electrolyte imbalance (including k+ level by renal handling). Option B, NS 0.45% has a lower concentration of sodium compared to NS 0.9%, which may not be sufficient to correct the hyponatremia. Option C, NS 0.9% and insulin, is not the best choice in this case as the patient's glucose level is already in the lower normal range and administering insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Option D, insulin alone, is not appropriate as the mild hyperkalemia does not require this treatment. Option E, dextrose, is not indicated for the electrolyte imbalance present and may cause an increase in blood glucose levels, which is not needed in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

[abdominal pain, dark urine (hematuria) and hypertension suggests adpkd.  the sensitivity of ultrasonography for adpkd1 is 99% for at-risk patients older than 20 years].","The correct answer is A. Ultrasonography (US). This is because the patient's presentation of abdominal pain, dark urine (hematuria) and hypertension suggest Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). US is the most appropriate initial investigation for ADPKD as it is non-invasive and has a sensitivity of 99% for at-risk patients older than 20 years. Renal biopsy (B) is not necessary in this case as a diagnosis of ADPKD can be made with US. CT (C) may be useful, but it is more expensive and exposes the patient to radiation. Urine protein (D) and urine microscopy (E) are not relevant in the diagnosis of ADPKD and do not provide information on the presence of renal cysts. Therefore, the most appropriate investigation for this patient is A. US.",a,a,TRUE,

[*** please note, in similar question where asked about hiv positive child’s vaccination and the answer was give all vaccines except bcg. hiv positive is not in a immunodeficient state and can receive live attenuated vaccines (except bcg), where as child with aids means he has criteria of immunodeficiency already for which all live attenuated vaccines should be avoided]. [please note the two terms “hiv positive” and “with aids”].","The correct answer for a 12-month-old child with AIDS due for an MMR vaccination is not to give the vaccine (choice b). AIDS means that the child is already in an immunodeficient state, and live attenuated vaccines like MMR should be avoided. It is important to note that ""HIV positive"" and ""with AIDS"" are not the same, and the former does not require the avoidance of live attenuated vaccines (except BCG). Deferring immunization for two weeks (choice a) or giving a half dose of vaccine (choice c) is not appropriate in this case. Additionally, giving paracetamol with future doses of the same vaccine (choice d) is not necessary. The single most appropriate action in this scenario is to not give the MMR vaccine.",b,b,TRUE,
"994. a young man presents with sudden, severe pain and swelling in the scrotum. exam: one testis seems higher than the other. what is the most probable dx?",a. varicocele,b. hematocele,c. testicular tumor,d. epidiymo-orchitis,e. testicular torsion,,,,,,"key: the key is e. testicular torsion. [sudden severe pain, scrotal swelling and higher position of the affected testis is diagnostic of testicular torsion. you may get further support  from examining cremesteric reflex which is absent in testicular torsion].","Based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis would be e) testicular torsion. The sudden and severe pain, along with scrotal swelling and a higher position of one testis indicates a potential twisting of the spermatic cord, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Varicocele is a swelling of veins within the scrotum that is often painless and typically affects the left testicle. Hematocele is a collection of blood within the scrotum that may cause discomfort but is typically not associated with sudden and severe pain. Testicular tumor is a possibility but is less likely to present with sudden and severe pain and swelling. Epididymo-orchitis is an inflammation or infection of the epididymis or testicle that may cause pain and swelling but is less likely to cause a higher position of one testis. Therefore, based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis is testicular torsion.",e,e,TRUE,
995. a 24yo male involved in rta with xr: fx neck of humerus. what is the single most associated nerve injury?,a. axillary nerve,b. radial nerve,c. median nerve,d. ulnar nerve,,,,,,,key: the key is a. axillary nerve.,"The correct answer to the question is a. axillary nerve. The neck of the humerus is located close to the surgical neck where the axillary nerve runs. Injuries to this area can cause damage to the axillary nerve resulting in functional deficits. The axillary nerve primarily innervates the deltoid muscle and teres minor muscle, which are essential for arm abduction and external rotation. In contrast, the other nerve choices listed do not pass through this area or provide innervation to these muscles. Therefore, the axillary nerve injury is most commonly associated with this type of fracture, making it the correct answer.",a,a,TRUE,
996. a 64yo man complains of increasing sob and cough for the past 18m. he coughs up a tbsp of mucopurulent sputum with occasional specks of blood. what is the most likely underlying cause?,a. acute bronchitis,b. bronchiectasis,c. chronic bronchitis,d. lung cancer,e. pneumonia,,,,,,"key: the key is c. chronic bronchitis. [there may be specks of blood in sputum in both bronchiectasis , acute and chronic bronchitis. duration of disease is 18 months, so it is not acute bronchitis. again only one tablespoonful sputum does not justify the term copious sputum of bronhiectasis in which sputum will be much more like cup-full in amount. so it is chronic bronchitis].","Based on the given information, the most likely underlying cause of the man's symptoms is chronic bronchitis. This is indicated by the duration of symptoms being 18 months, which rules out acute bronchitis as a possibility. Additionally, the quantity of sputum being only one tablespoonful and the presence of occasional specks of blood do not justify a diagnosis of bronchiectasis or lung cancer, as these conditions typically present with much more copious amounts of sputum and more frequent episodes of coughing up blood. Pneumonia is also unlikely, as the symptoms have been ongoing for an extended period of time and would be expected to have resolved or worsened by now. Therefore, chronic bronchitis is the most likely cause of the man's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
997. a 55yo man who is hypertensive suddenly lost his vision. the retina is pale and fovea appears as a bright cherry red spot. what is the single most appropriate tx?,a. pan retinal photocoagulation,b. corticosteroids,c. scleral buckling,d. surgical extraction of lens,e. pressure over eyeball,,,,,,"key: the key is e. pressure over eyeball.

The correct answer is e, applying direct pressure over the eyeball for 5-15 seconds and repeating it several times. Hypertension is a major cause of CRAO, which results in pale retina and a cherry red spot in the fovea. Ocular massage can dislodge the embolus and improve retinal perfusion. The other answer choices are incorrect. Pan retinal photocoagulation (a) is used for diabetic retinopathy; corticosteroids (b) are used for inflammation and edema; scleral buckling (c) is used for retinal detachment; and surgical extraction of lens (d) is used for cataracts.",e,e,TRUE,
998. a 32yo man with schizophrenia and a hx of violence and distressing auditory hallucinations was admitted to the ward with aggressive behavior and has already smashed his room. he is refusing any oral meds. what is the single most appropriate injection?,a. flupenthixol,b. fluphenazine,c. haloperidol,d. paraldehyde,e. risperidone,,,,,,key: the key is c. haloperidol. [if oral preparation was asked we could give risperidone but in question asked injectable preparation. injection risperidone is a depot preparation the action of which takes few days to start. so in acute case it is not suitable; hence from the given options haloperidol is the best choice].,"The correct answer is c. Haloperidol. In this situation, the patient's violent and aggressive behavior requires an immediate solution, and since he is not willing to take any oral medications, the most appropriate choice would be an injectable medication. While risperidone may be a suitable option for oral administration, it is not recommended for Acute agitation and psychosis due to its slow onset of action in depot preparation. Paraldehyde is not generally used for treating schizophrenia, and flupenthixol and fluphenazine are both less potent than haloperidol, making it a less preferable choice for a patient with a history of violence and distressing hallucinations. Therefore, based on the given scenario, haloperidol is the best choice of injection to manage the patient's immediate symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
"999. a 65yo man complains of hematuria, frequency, hesistancy and nocturia. he reports that on certain occasions he finds it difficult to control the urge to pass urine. urine microscopy confirms the presence of blood but no other features. what is the most porbable dx?",a. bph,b. bladder ca,c. prostatic ca,d. pyelonephritis,e. prostatitis,,,,,,key: there are two keys a. bph and c. prostatic carcinoma. [there are no constitutional features of carcinoma. bleeding is more common in bph and occurs in a minority of cases and much less common in prostatic carcinoma. features given are of prostatism only which favours the diagnosis of bph].,"Based on the symptoms described by the patient and the presence of blood in the urine, the most probable diagnosis is a. BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). The patient exhibits typical symptoms of prostatism, including frequency, hesitancy, and nocturia. While bleeding can occur in both BPH and prostatic carcinoma, it is more common in BPH and occurs in a minority of cases. Constitutional symptoms are not present, which rules out the possibility of cancer. Bladder cancer and pyelonephritis are not likely as blood in the urine is the only reported abnormality, and symptoms of prostatitis are also absent. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is BPH.",a,a,TRUE,
1000.   a 60yo man presents with mass in the groin. exam: mass lies below the midpoint of the inguinal ligament and is pulsatile. what is the most probable dx?,a. direct inguinal hernia,b. saphenavarix,c. femoral hernia,d. irreducible hernia,e. femoral aneurysm,,,,,,key: the key is c. femoral hernia. wrong key! correct key is femoral aneurism . [hernia below pubic tubercle (below inguinal ligament) is femoral hernia. but below mid-inguinal point and pulsatile mass is femoral aneurism].,"The correct answer for the given scenario is e) femoral aneurysm, rather than c) femoral hernia. The patient is a 60-year-old man who presents with a pulsatile mass in the groin. The key feature in this scenario is the location of the mass, which is below the inguinal ligament's midpoint. This location is classically associated with the femoral artery rather than a hernia. Moreover, the pulsatile nature of the mass further supports it being a femoral aneurysm. A direct inguinal hernia, saphenavarix, and irreducible hernia are unlikely diagnoses in this context. Therefore, a femoral aneurysm is the most probable diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,
"1001. an 82yo man has woken up with incoherent speech and difficulty in finding the right words. exam: otherwise normal, good comprehension. which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?",a. broca’s area,b. wernicke’s area,c. midbrain,d. parietal cortex,e. pons,,,,,,"key: the key is a. brocha’s area. [a person with expressive aphasia will exhibit halting and effortful speech. speech may only include important content words. word comprehension is preserved. the person may still be understood, but sentences will not be grammatical. this contrasts with receptive or wernicke’s aphasia, which is distinguished by a patient's inability to comprehend language or speak with appropriately meaningful words though fluency may be preserved].","The correct answer is A, Broca’s area. This is because the patient is exhibiting symptoms of expressive aphasia, which is caused by damage to Broca’s area in the brain. In expressive aphasia, speech is halting and effortful, and may only include important content words. However, word comprehension is preserved and the person may still be understood, albeit with difficulty. This distinguishes it from receptive or Wernicke’s aphasia, which is characterized by an inability to comprehend language or use appropriately meaningful words, while fluency may be preserved. The other answer choices (C, D, and E) are unlikely to be the cause of the patient’s symptoms as they are not associated with language processing. Therefore, the most likely site of damage in this case is Broca’s area.",a,a,TRUE,
"1002. a 25yo woman has a recent cough, hoarseness and swelling in the neck. there are several nontender swellings on both sides of her neck. she has lost 13kgs. she takes recreational drugs. what is the most probable dx?",a. thyrotoxicosis,b. hyperthyroidism,c. vocal cord nodules,d. carcinoma bronchus,e. tb,,,,,,"key: the key is e. tb. [cough, wt. loss, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy, and immunodeficient state as a result of recreational drug use all these favours the diagnosis of tb. laryngeal involvement may be the cause of horseness].","The most probable diagnosis for the 25-year-old woman presenting with a recent cough, hoarseness, neck swelling, nontender lymphadenopathy, and weight loss is TB (tuberculosis). The immunodeficient state resulting from recreational drug use, along with the specific symptoms, all point towards TB as the most likely cause. Laryngeal involvement could also contribute to the hoarseness. Thyrotoxicosis and hyperthyroidism do not present with the same symptoms and would not cause lymphadenopathy. Vocal cord nodules may cause hoarseness but do not explain the other symptoms. Carcinoma bronchus is possible but does not account for the immunodeficient state, making TB the most probable diagnosis.",e,e,TRUE,
1003. a 30yo woman presents with acute headache. she complains of seeing halos especially at night. what is the single most likely defect?,a. paracentral scotoma,b. mono-ocular field loss,c. tunnel vision,d. central scotoma,e. cortical blindness,,,,,,key: the key is c. tunnel vision. [the diagnosis is glaucoma (headache and haloes especially at night). in glaucoma there occurs tunnel vision].,"The correct answer is c. tunnel vision. The presenting symptoms of acute headache and seeing halos, especially at night, are indicative of glaucoma. In glaucoma, there is a gradual loss of peripheral vision, leading to tunnel vision. Therefore, the most likely defect is tunnel vision. Option a. paracentral scotoma refers to a loss of vision in a particular area in the central part of the visual field, which does not fit with the given symptoms. Option b. mono-ocular field loss refers to vision loss in one eye, while the woman's symptoms are bilateral. Option d. central scotoma refers to vision loss in the center of the visual field, which is not consistent with peripheral loss. Option e. cortical blindness refers to loss of vision due to damage to the visual cortex, while in glaucoma, the damage occurs in the optic nerve, ruling out this option.",c,c,TRUE,
1004. a 35yo man presents with a headache that worsens on bending his head forward. what is the most likely dx?,a. chronic sinusitis,b. sah,c. migraine,d. cluster headache,e. tension headache,,,,,,key: the key is a. chronic sinusitis.,"The most likely diagnosis for a 35-year-old man presenting with a headache that worsens when bending his head forward is chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinus lining that causes pressure and pain in the face, head, and neck. The headache in this case is most likely caused by the buildup of pressure and congestion in the sinuses, which worsens when the head is lowered. The other choices - sah, migraine, cluster headache, and tension headache - can be ruled out as they do not typically worsen with forward head movement. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah) is a medical emergency that presents with sudden, severe headache, often accompanied by neurological symptoms. Migraine, cluster headache, and tension headache typically cause pain that may be unilateral, throbbing, and/or accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to light or sound. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms, chronic sinusitis is the most likely diagnosis and the other choices are less likely.",a,a,TRUE,
"1005. a 20yo man presents with painful swallowing. exam: trismus and unilateral enlargement of his tonsils. the peritonsilar region is red, inflamed and swollen. what is the most appropriate tx?",a. oral antibiotics,b. iv antibiotics and analgesics,c. i&d with antibiotics,d. analgesics with antipyretics,e. tonsillectomy,,,,,,key: the key is c. i&d with antibiotics. [the dx is peritnsillar abscess and tx is i&d with antibiotics].,"The most appropriate treatment for the patient described in this scenario is option C: i&d with antibiotics. Peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of tonsillitis and should be managed urgently to prevent further complications. The presence of trismus and unilateral enlargement of the tonsils is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Antibiotics alone may not be effective in treating the abscess, and tonsillectomy is considered a last resort. The most effective treatment option is to perform an incision and drainage (i&d) of the abscess and administer antibiotics to prevent recurrence. Therefore, option A is not the best choice as it does not address the abscess. Option B is not the most appropriate choice as iv antibiotics are not always necessary unless the patient is severely ill. Option D is not ideal since analgesics and antipyretics alone may not be effective in treating the abscess. Lastly, option E is not the most appropriate as tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure reserved for complicated cases.",c,c,TRUE,
1006. a 40yo manual worker presents with a swelling in the groin. exam: mass is found to be just above and lateral to the pubic tubercle. it is reducible. on applying pressure on the internal ring there is no cough impulse seen. what is the most probable dx?,a. direct inguinal hernia,b. indirect inguinal hernia,c. femoral hernia,d. strangulated hernia,e. femoral aneurysm,,,,,,"key: the key is b. indirect inguinal hernia. [swelling in the groin; mass just above and lateral to the pubic tubercle means inguinal hernia. it is reducible. on applying pressure on the internal ring there is no visible cough impulse; it means the hernia enters through deep ring, and enters scrotum passing through the superficial ring. that means it is indirect inguinal hernia].","The most probable diagnosis in this case is b) indirect inguinal hernia. The swelling being just above and lateral to the pubic tubercle suggests an inguinal hernia, and the fact that it is reducible indicates that it is not an emergency situation such as a strangulated hernia. The absence of a cough impulse when pressure is applied to the internal ring suggests that the hernia enters through the deep ring and goes into the scrotum, passing through the superficial ring, which is characteristic of an indirect inguinal hernia. Direct inguinal hernias, on the other hand, occur when the hernia bulges through a weak point in the abdominal wall, and do not pass through the deep ring. Femoral hernias would present as a swelling below the pubic tubercle, and femoral aneurysms are very rare. Therefore, b) indirect inguinal hernia is the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
"1007. a 34yo male presents with headache and vomiting. exam: temp=38.5c, neck stiffness, discharge from left ear and right sided hyper-reflexia with an extensor plantar response. what is the most likely dx?",a. cerebral tumor,b. meningitis,c. cerebellar tumor,d. cerebral abscess,e. normal pressure hydrocephalus,,,,,,key: the key is d. cerebral abscess. [otitis media can lead to cerebral abscess].,"The correct answer is d. cerebral abscess. The symptoms of headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, and discharge from the left ear are indicative of otitis media, which is an infection of the middle ear. If left untreated, otitis media can spread to the brain and cause complications such as cerebral abscess, which is a collection of pus within the brain tissue. The right-sided hyper-reflexia with an extensor plantar response could suggest a focal neurological deficit, which is a common sign of cerebral abscess. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms would be cerebral abscess. The other answer choices, including cerebral tumor, meningitis, cerebellar tumor, and normal pressure hydrocephalus, do not fully match the patient's symptoms and would be less likely diagnoses.",d,d,TRUE,
1008. a 26yo male presents with speech difficulties. exam: nystagmus. which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?,a. midbrain,b. pons,c. cerebellum,d. cerebrum,e. vestibule cochlear nerve,,,,,,key: the key is c. cerebellum. [difficulty speech (cerebellar dysarthria) and nystagmus are suggestive of cerebellar lesion].,"Based on the presented symptoms and exam findings, the most likely anatomical site affected in this 26-year-old male is the cerebellum, making option c the correct answer. Difficulty with speech, or cerebellar dysarthria, and the presence of nystagmus are both suggestive of a cerebellar lesion. The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating movement and balance, as well as playing a role in speech and language function. The midbrain, pons, cerebrum, and vestibule cochlear nerve are all possible locations of neurological deficits, but given the symptoms presented in this case, the cerebellum is the most likely culprit.",c,c,TRUE,

The patient presents with Bell's palsy, late onset asthma, heart failure, generalized rash, multiple soft shadows on CXR, and eosinophilia, four out of six criteria for CSS diagnosis. C-anca and anti-ds DNA are more commonly associated with other types of vasculitis, while anti-centromere and anti-Ro antibodies are associated with autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma and Sjogren's syndrome, respectively. Therefore, p-anca should be the most likely positive antibody in this case, indicating CSS as the diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
1010. a 50yo man complains of visual prbs and dull pain in the left eye. fundoscopy reveals papilloedema. he was dx with ms 2yrs ago. there is no consensual light reflex of the right eye. what is the single most likely defect?,a. paracentral scotoma,b. mono-ocular field loss,c. homonymous upper quadrantanopia,d. central scotoma,e. homonymous lower quadrantanopia,,,,,,key: the key is b. mono-ocular field loss.,"Based on the information provided, the most likely defect is option B, mono-ocular field loss. The presence of papilloedema indicates increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to optic nerve damage and consequent vision loss. The absence of consensual light reflex in the right eye further supports this hypothesis. Paracentral scotoma (option A), homonymous upper quadrantanopia (option C), and homonymous lower quadrantanopia (option E) are all patterns of visual field loss that occur when there is damage to the visual pathway in the brain. However, in this case, the field loss is only in one eye and therefore doesn't fit any of these patterns. Central scotoma (option D) is a type of visual field loss characterized by a blind spot in the center of the visual field, which is not the case here. Therefore, mono-ocular field loss is the most likely defect that matches with the given information.",b,b,TRUE,

[in stroke window period to use alteplase is 4.5 hours. in the given history we can in no way certain the time of stroke and we can not proceed for alteplase unless window period is confirmed. hence we cannot give alteplase but aspirin].,"The most appropriate treatment for this 54-year-old patient who presents with right-sided weakness and left cerebral infarct is option B, aspirin. While alteplase may be used to treat stroke, it can only be administered within a specific time window of 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms, and in this case, we cannot confirm the time of the stroke. Clopidogrel and dipyridamole are antiplatelet agents that may be used in patients with recurrent strokes, but aspirin is the first-line treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Simvastatin is a statin that is used to treat high cholesterol, but it is not indicated for acute stroke management. The patient's high blood pressure may also need to be addressed with medication. Therefore, in this patient, aspirin is the most appropriate treatment option.",b,b,TRUE,

[before hospitalization iv benzylpenicillin. in hospital ceftriaxone can be given but not in calcium containing fluid instead give cefotaxime (nice). according to ohcm hospital management is cefotaxime if <55yrs and cefotaxime + ampicillin if >55yrs ].,"Based on the patient's symptoms of headaches, photophobia and rash, it is important to consider the possibility of meningitis. Therefore, starting intravenous benzylpenicillin would be the most appropriate course of action. Option A, sending the patient home, would be dangerous as they could deteriorate quickly without proper treatment. Option C, conducting a lumbar puncture, would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis but should not delay prompt treatment. Option D, starting intravenous ceftriaxone, is contraindicated if the patient is also receiving calcium-containing fluids, which may be the case in this scenario. Furthermore, according to the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, cefotaxime is the recommended treatment for meningitis in patients under 55 years old, while in patients over 55 years old, both cefotaxime and ampicillin should be used. Therefore, starting intravenous benzylpenicillin as advised is the most appropriate action for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

[this is a case of siadh secondary to lung cancer and in case of siadh even in sever hyponatremia 1st line treatment is fluid restriction. so for this question answer is c. fluid restriction].,"In this case, the correct treatment for the patient's sodium level of 122mmol/l is c. restrict fluids. This is due to the fact that the patient is suffering from SIADH secondary to lung cancer, and in SIADH, the first line of treatment, even in severe hyponatremia, is fluid restriction. Demeclocycline and vasopressin are not the appropriate treatments for this condition. Therefore, fluid restriction is the correct answer for this question considering the patient's SIADH secondary to lung cancer.",c,c,TRUE,

[no vaginal bleeding and pain above pelvis makes pregnancy complication less likely. loose motion, low grade temperature and positive mc burney’s sign makes the diagnosis of appendicitis more probable].","The most probable diagnosis in this case is c. appendicitis. This is due to the presence of symptoms such as central abdominal pain, vomiting, and loose motion, as well as a low-grade fever and positive McBurney's sign (rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa). The fact that there is no vaginal bleeding and the pain is above the pelvis makes pregnancy-related complications less likely. Salpingitis and PID can present with similar symptoms, but they often have vaginal discharge, cervical tenderness, and uterine tenderness upon examination. Ovarian torsion, on the other hand, typically presents with sudden onset of severe pain in the lower abdomen, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Uterine fibroids usually cause pain during menstruation and are not typically associated with rebound tenderness. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is appendicitis.",c,c,TRUE,

MRI brain. These symptoms are indicative of a cerebellar lesion, which is located in the posterior fossa organ. For posterior fossa lesions, MRI is the investigation of choice as it provides more detailed and accurate images than CT or PET scans. Carotid angiography and monitoring for 24 hours are not appropriate initial investigations for this presentation. Therefore, the correct answer is c. MRI brain.",c,c,TRUE,

[diagnosis is given in question as severe depression and as features of psychosis present the better diagnosis would be psychotic depression. as onset is beyond 4 weeks it is no more post partum psychosis. so the 1st line treatment for psychotic depression is combination of antipsychotic + antidepressant. as the combination is not given as options first choice goes for antipsychotic that is e. haloperidol].,"The correct answer to the question is e. Haloperidol. The woman's symptoms suggest that she may be suffering from psychotic depression, characterized by severe depression with features of psychosis. As the onset of these symptoms occurred beyond 4 weeks postpartum, it is not considered postpartum psychosis. The first line treatment for psychotic depression is a combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant medication. Since the combination is not given as an option, the choice goes to the antipsychotic medication, which is Haloperidol. Fluoxetine and citalopram are antidepressants, which may not be effective in treating psychosis symptoms. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is typically not the first line treatment for psychotic depression. ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) is also an option, but it may not be preferred due to the patient's breastfeeding status.",e,e,TRUE,

[extreme tenderness to examine indicate otitis externa].,"Based on the information provided, the correct answer is D, otitis externa. Otitis externa is a condition that occurs when the ear canal becomes inflamed, often as a result of infection. The severe pain and extreme tenderness to examine in the patient's ear are indicative of this condition. While the other answer choices do involve ear-related issues, they are not as likely given the information provided. Chondromalacia is a condition related to cartilage, furuncle is a type of skin infection, myringitis involves inflammation of the eardrum, and OM (otitis media) is an infection of the middle ear. These conditions are not as closely related to the symptoms described by the patient. In summary, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's condition is otitis externa due to the severe pain and extreme tenderness to examine.",d,d,TRUE,

[acramposate is not a deterrent (which keeps away from drinking by making it unpleasant) but disulfirum!],"The correct answer to this question is a. disulfiram. Disulfiram is a drug that causes an unpleasant physical reaction when alcohol is consumed. This serves as a deterrent to individuals who want to avoid drinking again. On the other hand, acamprosate is not a deterrent drug and is instead used to reduce cravings for alcohol. Vitamin supplements and naloxone/naltrexone are not indicated for use as a deterrent drug for alcohol consumption.

[typical presentation of streptococcal pneumonia].,"Based on the presented case, the most likely organism causing the patient's symptoms is a. Streptococcus pneumonia. The patient's age, cough, fever, rusty colored sputum, and right lower lobe consolidation on CXR are classic presentations of Streptococcus pneumonia infection. Staphylococcus aureus is another possible cause of pneumonia but tends to have a more severe and rapid onset. Coxiella burnetti and Mycoplasma pneumonia are unlikely given the patient's age and clinical presentation. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is a. Streptococcus pneumonia, which aligns with the typical presentation of the disease and the patient's symptoms.",a,a,TRUE,

While MRI is useful for soft tissue, it is not the best option for bone imaging. If the patient had radiculopathy, spinal cord compression, or a prolapsed disc creating pressure on a nerve, MRI would be appropriate, but it is not the best choice for investigating bony metastasis. A DEXA scan would help detect osteoporosis, but it is not useful in evaluating bone metastasis. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium concentrations can be elevated in patients with bone metastasis, but they are not specific enough to establish a diagnosis and should not be used as the primary investigation. Overall, the most appropriate investigation for this patient's symptoms and history is a radionuclide bone scan, which can detect osteoblastic activity and bone involvement in patients with cancer.",b,b,TRUE,

The patient's presentation with increased skin pigmentation, spider angioma, cardiomegaly, s3 gallop, and an enlarged liver suggests a condition called haemochromatosis. This condition is characterized by excess iron absorption and can lead to cirrhosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and an increased risk of hepatocellular cancer (hepatoma). The other answer choices are not related to the patient's presentation and can be ruled out. Cerebellar degeneration is a neurological condition that causes problems with coordination and movement. Wernicke's encephalopathy is a severe form of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency that can cause confusion, vision changes, and muscle weakness. Renal failure is a condition in which the kidneys are unable to properly filter waste from the blood.

1022. a 39yo male presents with visual symptoms. ophthalmoscopy shows papilloedema. which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?,a. optic nerve,b. optic disc,c. optic radiation,d. occulomotor nerve,e. optic chiasma,,,,,,key: the key is b. optic disc.,"The correct answer is b. optic disc. Papilloedema is a condition where there is swelling in the optic disc due to increased pressure in the intracranial space. The optic nerve (answer a) is a bundle of nerves that transmits visual information from the eye to the brain and is not likely to be affected in this scenario. The optic radiation (answer c) refers to the pathways that convey visual information from the thalamus to the visual cortex in the brain and is not directly related to papilloedema. The occulomotor nerve (answer d) controls the movement of the eye and eyelid and is unlikely to be impacted by papilloedema. The optic chiasma (answer e) is a cross-shaped structure where the optic nerves from both eyes meet and exchange information, but it is not commonly affected by papilloedema. Therefore, the optic disc, the site where the optic nerve exits the eye, is the most likely site to be impacted in this case due to the swelling.",b,b,TRUE,

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) would be appropriate for mild depression, while electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) would be reserved for severe or psychotic depression. Amitriptyline and dosulepine are not suitable for this patient due to their tendency to cause urinary retention, which could exacerbate his symptoms. Diazepam is not typically used as a first-line treatment for depression. Therefore, citalopram is the preferred option for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

[this pain is likely due to nerve injury during operation and both amitryptilin and gabapentine are 1st line for neuropathic pain].,"The correct answer for the next step in treating a 48-year-old patient who presents with perioral paresthesia and severe pain after a surgical removal of mandibular cancer is F - Gabapentin (1st line). This pain is likely due to nerve injury during the operation and both amitriptyline and gabapentin are 1st line for neuropathic pain. Oral morphine has already been tried and was ineffective for the patient. Option A - Oral amitriptyline (2nd line) can be a viable option, but since it is a 2nd line treatment, it would be more appropriate to try the 1st line treatment first. Option B - Oral oxycodone, Option C - PCA, Option D - IV morphine, and Option E - Fentanyl patch are all opioid analgesics that are generally used for nociceptive pain and are less effective in treating neuropathic pain caused by nerve injury. Therefore, Gabapentin as a 1st line treatment is the most suitable option for this patient.",f,f,TRUE,

Otoscopy is a diagnostic tool used to examine the ear canal and the tympanic membrane. Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TM) can cause the symptoms described, and diagnosis is based on otoscopy. The other options listed are not appropriate as an initial investigation for this case. CT (option A) and MRI (option B) may be used in specific cases, but they are not the first-line investigation for this presentation. Skull X-ray (option D) and facial X-ray (option E) are also not recommended for this case as they do not provide useful information about TM perforation. Treatment for TM perforation varies depending on the severity of the case, but in general, surgery may be needed if the perforation persists after two months, and antibiotics may be necessary if there is an infection. Therefore, the appropriate initial investigation for this 34-year-old man is otoscopy to diagnose the traumatic perforation of the TM.",c,c,TRUE,

[spreading annular rash suggests erythema migrans of lyme disease].,"The correct answer is c. Lyme antibodies. This is because the presentation of an annular rash with a scaly edge that spreads over time is suggestive of erythema migrans, which is a hallmark characteristic of Lyme disease. Additionally, the patient's complaints of general aches and pains are also consistent with early stage Lyme disease. Therefore, testing for Lyme antibodies is most useful for confirming or ruling out a diagnosis of Lyme disease. 

The other choices are unlikely to be helpful in diagnosing this particular patient's condition. Choice a, ANA, is a test for autoimmune diseases and is not relevant to this case. Choice b, biopsy lesion, may be useful in certain cases, but is not necessary in this case where there are clear clinical indicators for Lyme disease. Choice d, skin scrap for mycology, is used for diagnosing fungal infections, which is not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. Choice e, skin swab for bacteria, is similarly not relevant to this case as there is no clear indication for a bacterial infection. Therefore, the most useful investigation for this patient is testing for Lyme antibodies to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of Lyme disease.",c,c,TRUE,

Serum calcium concentration. The symptoms described - confusion, thirst, abdominal pain and ECG changes (shortened QT interval) - indicate hypercalcemia, which can result from metastases of the prostatic cancer to the bone. The serum calcium concentration is the most appropriate investigation to confirm or rule out this diagnosis. Options a, b, and c are not appropriate investigations for hypercalcemia or prostatic cancer, while option d (serum ALP concentration) may be elevated in bone metastases but is less specific than serum calcium concentration. In conclusion, the most appropriate investigation for this patient is serum calcium concentration, given the symptoms and likely diagnosis of hypercalcemia.",e,e,TRUE,

[epigastric pain is a warning sign of hellp syndrome. so to rule out hellp syndrome liver enzymes should be done].,"The appropriate investigation for a 27-year-old woman who developed epigastric pain 8 hours after a c-section is a liver enzyme test. Epigastric pain is a warning sign of HELLP syndrome, a life-threatening complication of pregnancy that affects the liver and blood clotting system. A liver enzyme test is essential to rule out this syndrome as a cause of the pain. ABG and coagulation profile testing are not necessary diagnostic tests for this patient's symptoms and liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that is not typically indicated in the first line of investigation for suspected HELLP syndrome. Therefore, the appropriate answer is C. Liver Enzyme testing.",c,c,TRUE,
1029. a 35yo woman presents with visual problems. ct brain reveals pituitary tumor. what is the single most likely defect?,a. homonymous hemianopia,b. homonymous upper quadrantopia,c. bitemporal hemianopia,d. cortical blindness,e. homonymous lower quadrantopia,,,,,,key: the key is c. bitemporal hemianopia. [pitutary tumour by pressing optic chiasma causes bitemporal hemianopia].,"The correct answer to this question is c. bitemporal hemianopia. This is because a pituitary tumor pressing on the optic chiasm causes a loss of peripheral vision, which is known as bitemporal hemianopia. Homonymous hemianopia refers to a loss of half of the visual field in both eyes on the same side, while homonymous upper and lower quadrantopia refer to loss of upper or lower quadrants of the visual field in both eyes on the same side. Cortical blindness is a form of blindness caused by damage to the brain's visual cortex. Therefore, bitemporal hemianopia is the most likely defect in this case as it is specific to the location of the tumor and the resulting pressure on the optic chiasm.",c,c,TRUE,

The individual in this situation has a history of heroin addiction which can lead to brain damage, and the fact that they cannot recall the accident after being paraplegic suggests further brain damage. While PTSD and severe depression can also be consequences of experiencing a traumatic event, they do not align with the specific symptoms presented in this case. Therefore, it is important to consider the patient’s medical history and neurological symptoms to determine the correct diagnosis in order to provide appropriate treatment.",c,c,TRUE,

[microenurism, hard exudates are seen in background diabetic retinopathy].","The correct answer is D, diabetic background retinopathy. This is because microaneurysms and hard exudates are characteristic findings of background diabetic retinopathy, which is one of the earliest stages of diabetic eye disease. Macular degeneration, hypertensive retinopathy, and multiple sclerosis are not associated with these particular features on fundus examination. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy usually occurs in more advanced stages of the disease. Therefore, the presence of microaneurysms and hard exudates in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus is highly suggestive of diabetic background retinopathy as the most likely diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,

[here serum albumin is 17. so the patient developed ascites and oedema secondary to reduced plasma colloidal osmotic pressure. albumin infusion can help rise the colloidal osmotic pressure and improve the patients condition].,"The correct answer is a, albumin infusion. The patient is presenting with ascites and edema due to reduced plasma colloidal osmotic pressure, as indicated by the low albumin level. Crystalloid IV (option b) and SC (option c) are not as effective as albumin in raising colloidal osmotic pressure. Fluids via NGT (option d) and PO (option e) are not appropriate since the patient is drowsy and may be unable to tolerate oral or enteral intake. Additionally, lactulose is already being administered for hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, albumin infusion is the single most appropriate management of his fluid intake.",a,a,TRUE,

[atrophy of buttock due to fat malabsorption and distended abdomen (sometimes with everted umbilicus) with frequent offensive smelly stools are seen in coeliac disease. hence endomyseal/alpha gliadin antibody should be done].,"The single most likely investigation for a 2-year-old with atrophy of the buttocks, distended abdomen with frequent offensive smelly stool is the endomyseal/alpha gliadin antibody test (option B). This test is used to diagnose coeliac disease, which is a common cause of malabsorption in children. The symptoms, such as a distended abdomen, are indicative of malabsorption, and the atrophy of the buttocks may be due to fat malabsorption. Upper GI endoscopy (option A) and colonoscopy (option D) may be required for further evaluation, but they are not the first-line investigations. The sweat test (option C) is used for diagnosing cystic fibrosis, but the symptoms are not suggestive of this condition. Stool culture (option E) may be useful to rule out any infections, but it is not helpful in diagnosing malabsorption. In summary, the endomyseal/alpha gliadin antibody test is most likely to provide a diagnosis for this patient's symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,

[severe back pain, high calcium level and renal impairment are typical of multiple myeloma].","The correct answer is D: Bence-Jones protein. The patient's severe back pain and high calcium level along with renal impairment are typical symptoms of multiple myeloma. Bence-Jones protein is a protein produced by abnormal plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma. Therefore, detecting Bence-Jones protein in the patient's urine will lead to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The other choices, such as US KUB, XR spine, and IVU, are unlikely to provide any significant information to diagnose multiple myeloma. In addition, since the patient is confused about her mother's visit, a mental state examination could be valuable as well. However, it is not the most likely investigation to lead to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Therefore, the most appropriate test to perform in this situation is a Bence-Jones protein test, which will enable a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.",d,d,TRUE,

[neck abscess. treated with iv antibiotics and drainage].,"The correct answer is a) IV antibiotics and drainage. The presentation of dysphagia, along with febrile symptoms, erythema, and middle neck swelling suggest a neck abscess is present. The most appropriate management strategy is to administer intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection, followed by drainage to remove any accumulated puss and reduce pressure on the surrounding tissues. Option b) antipyretics may be used to manage fever symptoms but do not address the underlying infection. Option c) x-ray of the neck may not provide enough detail to make an accurate diagnosis. Option d) endoscopic diverticulectomy is not an appropriate treatment for an abscess. Option e) I&D nan nan nan nan nan is unclear and not a viable treatment option. Therefore, the correct course of action to address the neck abscess in this case is a combination of intravenous antibiotics and drainage.",a,a,TRUE,

[hormonically active tumour, tumour causing pressure symptoms (like headache, visual disturbance) and large size of tumour are indications for surgical removal].","The correct answer is d. Surgery. This is because a hormonally active tumor, a tumor causing pressure symptoms (such as headaches and visual disturbances), and a large size of the tumor are all indications for surgical removal. Radiotherapy (option a) may be an option for residual or recurrent tumor after surgery, but it is not the first-line treatment. Octreotide (option b) is a medication used primarily for controlling hormonal symptoms of pituitary tumors, but it does not address the underlying tumor itself. Reassurance and follow-up (option c) may be appropriate for some benign and asymptomatic pituitary tumors, but not for this patient who is experiencing worsening symptoms. Chemotherapy (option e) is not typically used for pituitary tumors. In summary, the best treatment option for this young lady with a gradually worsening headache, visual disturbance, and a 15mm pituitary tumor would be surgical removal.",d,d,TRUE,

Referring the patient to a psychiatric evaluation in order to assess their mental capacity to give consent is the appropriate course of action in this scenario. The other choices are not informed by considerations regarding the patient's ability to give informed consent. While obtaining a letter signed by the GP or wife may provide some clarity around the patient's medical history or familial context, it does not directly address the question of whether the patient is able to understand the risks and benefits of the procedure and provides voluntary consent. In order to ensure that the patient's rights and welfare are being respected, it is important to gather information about their mental capacity in a clinical setting, such as through a psychiatric evaluation. This will help to determine their capacity to make informed decisions about their own medical care and ensure that their wishes are being heard and respected.",d,d,TRUE,

Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker commonly used to treat hypertension, and long term treatment of hypertension can lead to damage of the blood vessels in the retina, known as hypertensive retinopathy. The presence of flame shaped hemorrhages is a hallmark stage 3 finding in the grading system of hypertensive retinopathy (as described in the key). Macular degeneration (A) is a different condition that is usually associated with aging. Multiple sclerosis (C) is a neurological disorder that does not typically involve hemorrhages in the retina. Background diabetic retinopathy (D) is typically asymptomatic and does not cause flame hemorrhages. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (E) is a more advanced diabetic retinopathy stage that is characterized by neovascularization and does not involve flame hemorrhages. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also not typically associated with retinal flame hemorrhages (F).",b,b,TRUE,
1039. a pt whose pain is not relieved by oral codeine. what is the best management?,a. oral oxycodone,b. co-codamol,c. pca,d. iv morphine,e. oral morphine,,,,,,key: the key is e. oral morphine.,"The correct answer is E, oral morphine. Oral morphine is the gold standard for managing severe pain that is not relieved by oral codeine. This is because morphine is a potent opioid analgesic that can help provide effective pain relief. Option A, oral oxycodone, is also an opioid analgesic but it is not the first-line choice for managing severe pain. Option B, co-codamol, contains codeine which the patient has already shown to be ineffective at managing their pain. Option C, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), is a more suitable option for post-operative and chronic pain patients, rather than a single instance of pain. Option D, IV morphine, is not the best management for a patient whose pain can be managed orally, if tablet medication is possible.",e,e,TRUE,

[palpable mass in the abdomen “on feeding” (just after feeding the mass becomes more prominent and can be palpated more easily) is suggestive of pyloric stenosis. us is used to diagnose this].,"The single most likely investigation for a 6 week baby presenting with vomiting, irritability and a palpable mass in the abdomen on feeding would be ultrasound (US). A palpable mass in the abdomen just after feeding, as described in this scenario, is suggestive of pyloric stenosis. US is a non-invasive and accurate diagnostic tool for pyloric stenosis, as it allows visualization of the narrowed pylorus. Upper GI endoscopy, barium meal, CT abdomen and barium enema are less likely to provide the necessary information for diagnosis, and therefore, are not the correct choices in this scenario. Upper GI endoscopy requires sedation and may not visualize the pylorus appropriately. Barium meal may aid in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, but it can also cause bowel obstruction if the pylorus is severely stenosed. CT abdomen and barium enema are not used for the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis and are not recommended as first-line investigations in infants with these symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[serum psa is used to assess the progress of treatment. (if a man’s psa level rises after prostate cancer treatment, his doctor will consider a number of factors before recommending further treatment. additional treatment based on a single psa test is not recommended. instead, a rising trend in psa level over time in combination with other findings, such as an abnormal result on imaging tests, may lead a man’s doctor to recommend further treatment)].","The correct answer is b. serum psa. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein made in the prostate gland and its level in blood can be used as a marker for the progression of prostate cancer. In this case, the patient is being treated for adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, which lowers testosterone levels and can lead to a decrease in PSA levels. Therefore, the most appropriate investigation to assess treatment progress in this patient is serum PSA. Choice a, serum AFP, is not specific to prostate cancer and is usually elevated in liver and testicular cancers. Choice c, serum acid phosphatase, and choice d, serum ALP isoenzyme, are no longer routinely used as markers for prostate cancer because they are less specific and less sensitive than PSA. Choice e, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), is more commonly used for initial prostate cancer diagnosis or to guide biopsy but is not indicated for monitoring treatment progress. In summary, choice b, serum PSA, is the most appropriate investigation to assess treatment progress in a patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate receiving GnRH antagonist therapy.",b,b,TRUE,

The reason for this is that C7 is the vertebra that is closest to the thoracic spine. When a cervical injury occurs, it is often the case that the lowest affected vertebra is the one closest to the thoracic spine. This is due to the fact that the transition between the cervical and thoracic spine is a common site of injury. Choices b, c, and d are all incorrect because they are not in close proximity to the thoracic spine and are therefore less likely to be included on a cervical x-ray for this particular type of injury. It is important to keep in mind that different types of injuries may require different imaging techniques, so the answer may vary depending on the specifics of the injury.",a,a,TRUE,

[memory processing occur in temporal lobe. so as the patient lost memory his temporal lobe is involved. we know temporal lobe lesion causes “homonymous upper quadrantanopia” which is the key here!],"The correct answer is b. Homonymous upper quadrantanopia. This is highly likely because the patient has a known history of stroke and cannot remember anything about his life, indicating a loss of memory. The temporal lobe, which is responsible for memory processing, is typically affected in cases of stroke. Moreover, temporal lobe lesions are also known to cause homonymous upper quadrantanopia, where the patient loses vision in the upper quadrant of one visual field and the lower quadrant of the opposite visual field.

Anorexia nervosa is a serious and potentially life-threatening eating disorder that requires specialized treatment. In mild to moderate cases, routine referral can be made to the local community mental health team or adolescent unit, but if available, an eating disorder unit is the most appropriate management. The given case shows that the patient has a moderate form of anorexia nervosa with a BMI of 15.5, and routine referral would not be enough. The patient also has mild depressive symptoms, but prescribing antidepressants alone would not address the underlying eating disorder. Psychodynamic therapy may help address some psychological issues but would not be as effective as specialized eating disorder treatment. Therefore, referring the patient to an eating disorder clinic is the most appropriate management.",a,a,TRUE,
1045. a 36yo woman has an injury to the right external laryngeal nerve during a thyroid surgery. what symptom would be expected in this pt?,a. stridor,b. hoarseness,c. aphonia,d. dysphonia,e. aphasia,,,,,,"key: the key is d. dysphonia. [external laryngeal nerve (smaller, external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve) lesion causes mono toned voice (loss of ability to produce pitched sound) that is dysphonia].","The correct answer to this question is d. dysphonia. The external laryngeal nerve is a smaller, external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, and a lesion in this nerve can cause a mono toned voice, resulting in a loss of ability to produce pitched sound, which is dysphonia. Stridor, hoarseness, and aphonia are not expected in this case because they are associated with different nerves in the larynx. Stridor is typically caused by an obstruction in the airways, while hoarseness and aphonia are more commonly linked to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is located deeper in the neck. Aphasia is a language disorder and is not related to the larynx. Therefore, the correct answer is d. dysphonia, as this is the expected symptom for a patient with an injury to the right external laryngeal nerve during a thyroid surgery.",d,d,TRUE,

[a case of ramsay hunt syndrome defined as an acute peripheral facial neuropathy associated with erythematous vesicular rash of the skin of the ear canal, auricle (also termed herpes zoster oticus), and/or mucous membrane of the oropharynx caused by herpes zoster infection].","The correct answer is b, herpes zoster infection, which is also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome. This is a condition characterized by an acute peripheral facial neuropathy associated with erythematous vesicular rash of the skin of the ear canal, auricle, and/or mucous membrane of the oropharynx caused by the herpes zoster virus. In this case, the patient's symptoms of weakness of the left side of her face and painful ear with pustules indicate Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Chronic serous otitis media (choice a) is a condition that usually presents with fluid accumulation in the middle ear and is not associated with facial weakness or vesicular rash. Impacted earwax (choice c) and perforation of the eardrum (choice d) are also unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms. Finally, presbycusis (choice e) is a gradual hearing loss associated with aging and does not typically present with pain or facial weakness. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is b, herpes zoster infection/Ramsay Hunt syndrome.",b,b,TRUE,
1047. an 8wk baby boy is noted to be jaundiced. he is breast-feeding well and has gained 300g since birth. his stools are yellow and his urine is pale straw colored. what is the most likely dx?,a. galactosemia,b. biliary atresia,c. g6pd deficiency,d. breast milk jaundice,e. congenital viral infection,,,,,,"key: the key is a. galactosemia. [biliary atresia causes obstructive picture where stools are pale and urine becomes dark. hemolytic disorder like g6pd or spherocytosis causes appearance of jaundice in 1st 24 hours. in breastmilk jaundice, jaundice develops in 2nd week. also congenital viral infection (torch) occurs in 1st 24 hours. here there is failure to thrive also. so likely cause in the presented case is galactosemia].","The most likely diagnosis in this case is galactosemia. This is because the baby is exclusively breast-fed and has gained weight, ruling out biliary atresia which typically presents with pale stools and dark urine due to obstruction. Hemolytic disorders such as G6PD or spherocytosis usually present with jaundice in the first 24 hours of life, whereas breast milk jaundice presents in the second week. Congenital viral infections like TORCH usually result in failure to thrive, which is not seen in this case. Therefore, galactosemia seems to be the most likely cause for the jaundice in this baby. The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation.",a,a,TRUE,

This is a common organism associated with postpartum infections, including breast abscesses. Staphylococcus albus (b) is a less common cause of breast abscesses. Group B Streptococcus (c) and Streptococcus pyogenes (d) are more commonly associated with infections of the uterus and surgical site infections. Streptococcus faecalis (e) is more commonly associated with urinary tract infections. Therefore, the correct answer is Staphylococcus aureus (a) because of its high incidence in postpartum infections and specifically in breast abscesses.",a,a,TRUE,
1049. a 32yo man suffering from ms presents with blurring of vision. ophthalmoscopy shows pallor of the optic disc. which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?,a. optic nerve,b. optic disc,c. optic radiation,d. trigeminal,e. oculomotor nerve,,,,,,key: the key is a. optic nerve. [ ms--optic neuropathy which affects optic nerve and long standing optic neuropathy can be seen as pallor of optic disc in opthalmoscope].,"The correct answer is A) optic nerve. The optic nerve connects the eye to the brain and transmits visual information. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerve fibers, which can result in damage to the optic nerve causing optic neuropathy. The pallor of the optic disc, which is visible during ophthalmoscopy, is an indicator of long-standing optic neuropathy. Therefore, option A is the most likely anatomical site affected in this situation. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect as they are not related to optic neuropathy or the transmission of visual information.",a,a,TRUE,
1050. a 23yo man presents with severe pain in the right flank radiating to his groin. he is rolling about on the floor. an ivu confirms a stone in the ureter which is 8mm in size. which tx modality will be most effective?,a. fluids and alpha blockers,b. eswl,c. ccb,d. dormier basket,e. pcnl,,,,,,key: the key is b. eswl. [though for 8 mm stone we can use medical expulsive therapy but for this patient with agonizing pain “most effective” therapy seems to be eswl].,"The most effective treatment modality for a 23-year-old man with severe pain in the right flank, radiating to his groin, and an 8mm stone in the ureter is option B, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Although medical expulsive therapy could be used for an 8mm stone, since the patient is experiencing agonizing pain, it is important to consider the most effective therapy. Fluids and alpha blockers, option A, can help relieve mild symptoms, but in this case, a more aggressive treatment is indicated. CCB, option C, and Dormier basket, option D, are not appropriate for this size of stone. PCNL, option E, is generally reserved for larger stones and more complex cases. Therefore, ESWL is the best option for this patient to provide quick and effective relief from his symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
1051. a 37yo woman believes that her neighbours have been using her shower while she is away from home. her 42yo partner is convinced about this and calls the police. what term best describes this situ?,a. capgras syndrome,b. cotard syndrome,c. delusion of persecution,d. folie a deux,e. munchausen syndrome,,,,,,key: the key is d. folie a deux. [folie a deux is symptoms of a delusional belief and hallucinations that are transmitted from one individual to another as here from wife to husband].,"The correct answer is d. folie a deux. This is because folie a deux, also known as shared psychotic disorder, is a condition in which delusional beliefs or hallucinations are transmitted from one individual to another. In this case, the woman's partner is also convinced that their neighbors have been using their shower. Capgras syndrome (a) is a delusional belief that a familiar person has been replaced by an imposter, while Cotard syndrome (b) is the delusional belief that one is dead or does not exist. Delusion of persecution (c) is a belief that one is being targeted or harmed by others without evidence. Munchausen syndrome (e) is a disorder in which the individual feigns illness or induces symptoms in themselves for attention or sympathy. Therefore, the best term to describe this situation is folie a deux.",d,d,TRUE,
1052. a 45yo woman has dull pain in her right ear which has been present for several weeks. there is no discharge. chewing is uncomfortable and her husband has noticed that she grinds her teeth during sleep. the eardrum appears normal. what is the single most likely dx?,a. dental caries,b. mumps,c. om,d. temporomandibular joint pain,e. trigeminal neuralgia,,,,,,key: d. temporomandibular joint pain. [temporomandibular joint pain may cause pain in ear and teeth grinding is a recognized cause of this symptom].,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is temporomandibular joint pain (TMJ pain). The patient's symptoms of dull ear pain, discomfort when chewing, and teeth grinding during sleep are all commonly associated with TMJ pain. Dental caries and mumps are unlikely causes as there is no evidence of tooth decay or swelling of the parotid gland. OM (otitis media) is also unlikely as there is no evidence of ear discharge or fever. Although trigeminal neuralgia may present with facial pain similar to TMJ pain, the absence of typical triggers for trigeminal neuralgia such as touch or cold stimuli makes it less likely. Overall, TMJ pain is the most probable diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,
"1053. a 42yo lady had corrective surgery for cyanotic congenital heart disease at the age of 3y, after a palliative operation during infancy. there is a parasternal impulse and an early diastolic murmur. what is the most probable dx?",a. aortic regurgitation,b. ischemic mitral regurgitation,c. aortic stenosis,d. pulmonary stenosis,e. pulmonary regurgitation,,,,,,"key: the key is e. pulmonary regurgitation. [in the present day, some patients with tetralogy of fallot have survived for longer than 15-20 years after their first operation. the major problem encountered by these individuals is the development of pulmonary valvular regurgitation. it appears that a number of these individuals require pulmonary valve replacement (ref: medscape)].","Based on the information provided, the most probable diagnosis for this 42-year-old lady is e. pulmonary regurgitation. This is supported by the fact that she had corrective surgery for cyanotic congenital heart disease at a young age, and pulmonary regurgitation is a common complication in such cases with prolonged survival. The presence of a parasternal impulse and early diastolic murmur also suggest a valvular issue, with pulmonary regurgitation being the most likely cause. Aortic regurgitation, ischemic mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and pulmonary stenosis are all possible causes of a heart murmur, but they are less likely given the patient's history and symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is e. pulmonary regurgitation.",e,e,TRUE,
1054. a 45yo lady presents with hx of double vision and facial numbness. which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?,a. cerebral cortex,b. trigeminal nerve,c. oculomotor nerve,d. brain stem,e. basal ganglia,,,,,,key: the key is d. brain stem. [cerebral cortex will not cause features of cranial nerve lesions. trigeminal nerve: ophthalmic and maxillary divisions are pure sensory hence it is also not the answer. oculomotor does not cause facial numbness. these features are not of basal ganglia lesion also. these features only can be explained by cranial nerve involvement in brainstem lesion].,"Based on the presented symptoms of double vision and facial numbness, the most likely anatomical site that is affected is the brain stem (d). This is because cranial nerves responsible for these areas are located in the brain stem. Choosing the cerebral cortex (a) as the answer would be incorrect because it does not cause features of cranial nerve lesions. Trigeminal nerve (b) can also be eliminated as an answer option since its ophthalmic and maxillary divisions are pure sensory and do not account for facial numbness. Oculomotor nerve (c) cannot cause facial numbness and features of basal ganglia lesion (e) are not compatible with the given symptoms. Therefore, the only logical explanation for the presented symptoms is a brain stem lesion.",d,d,TRUE,
"1055. a 30yo woman has experienced restlessness, muscle tension and sleep disturbance on most days over the last 6m. she worries excessively about a number of everyday events and activities and is unable to control these feelings which are impairing her ability to hold down her job. what is the most likely dx?",a. panic disorder,b. gad,c. pheochromocytoma,d. acute stress disorder,e. social phobia,,,,,,key: the key is b. gad. [in gad patient is worried about different number of events every day. almost everything triggers the anxiety].,"Based on the symptoms provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 30-year-old woman is b. generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of everyday events and activities, and often includes restlessness, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Panic disorder (a) is typically characterized by sudden and intense periods of fear or panic, whereas acute stress disorder (d) is a short-term response to a traumatic event. Pheochromocytoma (c) is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause increased levels of adrenaline, leading to symptoms such as high blood pressure and rapid heartbeat, but does not typically present with symptoms of anxiety. Social phobia (e) involves a fear of social situations or performance situations, which is not indicated by the symptoms described in this case. Therefore, the best answer is b. generalized anxiety disorder.",b,b,TRUE,
1056. which of the following is not a degenerative corneal disease?,a. band keratopathy,b. marginal dystropathy,c. fatty/lipid degeneration,d. mooren’s ulcer,e. keratoconus,,,,,,key: the key is d. moorens ulcer. [all other options are degenrative disease of cornea except mooren’s ulcer which is a type of ulcerative keratitis].,"Out of the given options, mooren’s ulcer is not a degenerative corneal disease. The other answer choices - band keratopathy, marginal dystrophy, fatty/lipid degeneration, and keratoconus - are all types of degenerative changes that can occur in the cornea. Band keratopathy refers to the formation of calcium deposits in the cornea, marginal dystrophy involves the gradual thinning and degeneration of the cornea near the edges, fatty/lipid degeneration results in the accumulation of lipids in the cornea, and keratoconus is a progressive thinning and bulging of the cornea. On the other hand, mooren’s ulcer is a type of ulcerative keratitis, which is an inflammatory condition that can lead to the formation of ulcers in the cornea.",d,d,TRUE,

[nephritic picture, h/o sorethroat 2 weeks before presentation and biopsy reports are suggestive of post streptococcal glomerulonephritis].","The most probable diagnosis for this patient is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), indicated by his history of sore throat and recent onset of dark and bloody urine, along with a positive immune-fluorescence pattern on renal biopsy. PSGN is a type of kidney inflammation that occurs after an infection with certain strains of streptococcus bacteria, commonly affecting children and young adults. Membranous glomerulonephropathy, SLE, and Wegener's granulomatosis do not typically present with the specific symptoms or biopsy findings seen in this patient. IgA nephropathy may present with similar symptoms, but the biopsy results would show a different pattern of immunofluorescence. Therefore, answer choice D, post-strep GN, is the most appropriate diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,
1058. a 65yo lady presents with a 6h hx of facial droop and weakness in the left side of her body. what single agent will she be prescribed for her whole life?,a. clopidogrel,b. altepase,c. aspirin,d. labetalol,,,,,,,key: the key is a. clopidogrel. [for both tia and stroke clopidogrel is prescribed for life long if there are no drug allergies].,"The correct answer to this question is A, clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a medication that helps to prevent blood clots from forming. For patients who have experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, clopidogrel is often prescribed for life if there are no drug allergies. This is because individuals who have suffered from a TIA or stroke are at an increased risk of having another episode in the future and clopidogrel helps to reduce this risk. The other answer choices, such as alteplase and aspirin, may be prescribed for acute treatment or short-term use, but they are not typically prescribed for life-long use. Labetalol is a medication used to lower blood pressure, but it is not typically prescribed for patients who have experienced a TIA or stroke. Therefore, clopidogrel is the correct answer as it is the medication that will be prescribed for the rest of the patient's life to prevent future episodes of TIA or stroke.",a,a,TRUE,

[rash over buttock, abdominal pain and vomiting, blood in urine or stool suggest hsp].","The most probable diagnosis for this 10-year-old boy with a rash over his buttocks and symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood in urine or stool is HSP or Henoch-Schonlein purpura. The rash, along with the abdominal symptoms and blood in urine or stool, are characteristic symptoms of HSP. NAI or non-accidental injury is less likely as there is no history of trauma reported and social services have been notified upon arrival to the hospital. ITP or immune thrombocytopenic purpura is also unlikely as there is no history of a viral illness preceding the symptoms and a low platelet count is not mentioned. HUS or hemolytic uremic syndrome is possible but less likely as there is no history of bloody diarrhea or recent ingestion of contaminated food. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is HSP which is a systemic vasculitis affecting small blood vessels and can result in renal involvement.",c,c,TRUE,
1060. a man with hx of fall had confusion and laceration mark on the head. which is the most appropriate vessel affected?,a. basiliary artery,b. middle meningeal artery,c. vertebral artery,d. diploic vein,,,,,,,key: the key is b. middle meningeal artery. [considerable head injury and lucid interval (several episodes of transient confusion)points towards extradural hematoma which occurs frequently from bleeding from middle meningeal artery. subdural hematoma usually occur due to bleeding vein].,"The correct answer for this question is b. middle meningeal artery. The patient's history of a fall, confusion, and laceration mark on the head are indicative of considerable head injury, which often leads to extradural hematoma. The middle meningeal artery is commonly affected in cases of extradural hematoma, which causes bleeding and may result in a lucid interval of several episodes of transient confusion. It's crucial to note that subdural hematoma usually occurs due to bleeding from veins, making the options a, c, and d wrong. Therefore, the injury likely affected the middle meningeal artery, resulting in an extradural hematoma, which requires prompt medical attention.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the patient is drowsy and may have difficulty swallowing the medication if given orally. Diazepam is not typically given by injection as it may cause adverse effects and should only be administered by trained healthcare professionals. Additionally, subcutaneous (sc) administration may not be appropriate for this medication. While there may be some discomfort associated with per rectal administration, it is deemed the most effective route of delivery. Therefore, options a, b, c, and e are not the best delivery routes.",d,d,TRUE,

[coal miners pneumoconiosis].,"The most appropriate diagnosis for the presented case is e. progressive massive fibrosis, also known as coal miners pneumoconiosis, due to occupational exposure to coal dust. The symptoms and CXR findings are consistent with this disease, which results in the formation of round fibrotic tissue in the lungs causing a mixed restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect, irreversible airflow limitation, and reduced gas transfer. Churg-Strauss syndrome, cryptogenic organizing, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and molluscum contagiosum are all unrelated to the presented case and therefore not appropriate diagnoses. It is important to consider occupational history and exposure in patients presenting with respiratory symptoms to ensure a prompt and accurate diagnosis.",e,E,TRUE,
1063. a pt was complaining of pain within 6h after his appendectomy for gangrenous appendix. what med is the best option for his pain relief?,a. iv morphine,b. diclofenac per rectal,c. pca,d. tramadol,,,,,,,key: the key is d. tramadol.,"The correct answer for the best pain relief option for a patient complaining of pain within 6 hours after an appendectomy for a gangrenous appendix is d. tramadol. Tramadol is an opioid pain medication that can offer effective pain relief without the addiction risks associated with morphine in option a. Diclofenac in option b is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that may not provide sufficient pain relief for a post-operative patient. PCA in option c is a patient-controlled analgesia, which may not be appropriate for this patient given the recent surgery and potential complications. Therefore, tramadol is the most appropriate option for pain relief in this patient.",d,d,TRUE,
1064. a 62yo farmer presents with a persistent firm irregular lesion on upper part of pinna which grew over the last few months. what is the most appropriate dx?,a. basal cell,b. squamous cell,c. keratocanthoma,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. basal cell. [any ulcer which is located above the neck is always basal cell carcinoma until proven otherwise. (samson note)].,"The most appropriate diagnosis in this case would be basal cell carcinoma (BCC), choice A. BCC is the most common type of skin cancer and is typically found on areas of the body that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face and ears. In this case, the patient is a farmer and likely spends a lot of time outdoors in the sun. Additionally, the lesion is described as persistent, irregular, and having grown over the last few months, all of which are typical characteristics of BCC. Squamous cell carcinoma (choice B) is another type of skin cancer, but it typically presents as a scaly or crusted lesion, which is not consistent with the presentation described in this case. Keratoacanthoma (choice C) is another type of skin lesion that can mimic BCC, but it typically resolves on its own within a few months, which is not consistent with the persistence of the lesion in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

[haloperidol, raises serum prolactin levels to 20~40 ng/ml in therapeutic doses but risperidone causes around 171 ng/ml].","The correct answer to this question is e. risperidone. This is because, among the options provided, only risperidone is an antipsychotic medication that has a known side effect of causing erectile dysfunction. Haloperidol, which is the key provided in the question, is also an antipsychotic medication, but its side effects typically include elevated prolactin levels rather than erectile dysfunction. Fluoxetine and citalopram are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) commonly used to treat depression and anxiety, and clozapine is also an antipsychotic medication that can have a range of side effects but is not typically associated with erectile dysfunction. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the known side effects of the medications listed, the most likely cause of their erectile dysfunction is risperidone.",e,e,TRUE,
1066. what is the most likely dx based on this ecg,a. normal,b. vt,c. sinus tachycardia,d. wpw syndrome,e. a-fib,,,,,,key: the key is c. sinus tachycardia.,"Based on the presented ECG, the most likely diagnosis would be sinus tachycardia. This is because the P waves are present and uniform, indicating normal atrial depolarization, and the QRS complex is narrow and regular, showing normal ventricular depolarization. Sinus tachycardia occurs when the heart beats faster than normal, but in a regular rhythm, and can be caused by various factors including stress, fever, and caffeine intake. The other answer choices can be ruled out as VT and WPW syndrome would show abnormal QRS complex morphology, a-fib would show an absence of P waves, and a normal ECG pattern would not explain the observed tachycardia.",c,c,TRUE,
1067. a 45yo woman has recently been dx with ms and has been started on oral steroids. she is brought to the hosp after having ingested 100 paracetamol tablets 4h ago. she is refusing all med tx. what is the next best step?,a. observe,b. refer to psychiatrist to assess pts ability to refuse tx,c. gastric lavage,d. activated charcoal,e. refer to social worker,,,,,,key: the key is b. refer to psychiatrist to assess pt’s ability to refuse tx.,"In the scenario presented, the answer is b. The next best step would be to refer the patient to a psychiatrist to assess her ability to refuse treatment. This is important because the patient is refusing all medical treatment, which could be life-threatening, and it must be determined whether she is capable of making rational decisions regarding her own health. Option a, observe, is not the best choice as it does not address the patient's refusal of treatment. Option c, gastric lavage, and d, activated charcoal, are not the best choices as they are more useful immediately after ingestion, and 4 hours have already passed in this case. Option e, referring to a social worker, may not be the best choice here as the patient is in need of immediate medical attention, and it is not clear that a social worker is the most appropriate resource to address her refusal of treatment.",b,b,TRUE,

[impaired glucose tolerance is 2-hours glucose level 140-199 mg/dl (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/l) on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test].,"The correct answer is a. impaired glucose tolerance. Impaired glucose tolerance is defined as having a 2-hour glucose level between 140-199 mg/dl (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/l) on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. In this case, the patient is experiencing elevated glucose levels after consuming glucose on the oral glucose tolerance test, indicating impaired glucose tolerance. The other choices are unlikely as the patient's fasting blood sugar level is within normal range and there are no indications of diabetes insipidus, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is impaired glucose tolerance.",a,a,TRUE,

[probable epiglottitis. so airway should be secured].,"The correct answer is b, secure airway. The child is most likely experiencing epiglottitis, which can cause swelling and blockage of the airway. Therefore, the immediate priority is to secure the airway to ensure the child can breathe properly. Examining the throat or administering penicillin would not be the priority in this situation. Keeping the child laid flat could worsen the airway obstruction and is therefore not the correct answer. Overall, securing the airway is the most important initial step to ensure the child's safety and prevent any further complications.",b,b,TRUE,
1070. a pt presents with hemoptysis 7d after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. what is the next step of management?,a. explore again,b. pack it,c. oral antibiotics and discharge,d. admit and iv antibiotics,e. ice cream and cold fluid,,,,,,key: the key is d. admit and iv antibiotics. [secondary hemorrhage can occur due to infection causing sloughing out of part of arterial wall due  to infection. it is managed by iv antibiotics folloing admitting the patient to hspital].,"The correct answer is d. Admit the patient and administer IV antibiotics. This is because the presentation of hemoptysis 7 days after a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy suggests a possibility of secondary hemorrhage due to infection leading to sloughing out of a part of the arterial wall. IV antibiotics are necessary to treat the infection and prevent further complications. Option a, exploring again, may worsen the situation by causing more trauma to the affected area. Option b, packing the area, is contraindicated as it can dislodge the sloughed arterial wall and cause further bleeding. Option c, oral antibiotics and discharge, is insufficient as the patient's condition requires close monitoring and IV therapy. Option e, ice cream and cold fluids, is not a viable option for managing a potentially severe medical emergency. Therefore, admitting the patient and administering IV antibiotics is the most appropriate response in this scenario.",d,d,TRUE,

[mandibular tumour or tonsillar carcinoma would not be so mobile after such time period and benig parotid is likely diagnosis].,"Based on the clinical presentation described, the most probable diagnosis for the 55-year-old man with a progressively increasing swelling at the angle of the mandible that has remained mobile for 6 months is a benign parotid tumor. This is because a mandibular tumor or tonsillar carcinoma would not be as mobile after such a prolonged period, and a benign parotid tumor is a likely diagnosis. Option b, mandibular tumor, would present as a fixed swelling and tonsillar carcinoma, option c, would have associated symptoms such as sore throat or difficulty swallowing. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is a benign parotid tumor.",a,a,TRUE,
"1072. a 61yo man, known smoker, comes to the hospital with complaints of painless hematuria, urgency and dysuria. he has been worried about his loss of weight and reduced general activity. which inv would be diagnostic of his condition?",a. urine microscopy,b. ivu,c. ct,d. cystoscopy,e. us abdomen,f. kub,g. cystoscopy with biopsy,h. mid stream urine for culture,i. trans rectal us,,"key: the key is g. cystoscopy with biopsy. [painless hematuria in elderly man is due to ca of bladder usually and in bladder cancer there are uti like symptoms like urgency, dysuria. also constitutional symptom like weight loss and reduced genral activity is feature of carinoma].","The most appropriate diagnostic investigation for this 61-year-old man, who presents with painless hematuria, urgency, and dysuria, along with concerns of weight loss and reduced activity, is g) cystoscopy with biopsy. The patient's history suggests bladder cancer, which commonly presents with hematuria and UTI-like symptoms. Constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss and reduced general activity, are also associated with bladder cancer. Urine microscopy, IVU, CT, US abdomen, KUB, and trans rectal US are not diagnostic of bladder cancer, and mid-stream urine for culture is unnecessary since UTI does not seem to be the primary diagnosis. Cystoscopy with biopsy will provide direct visualization of the bladder, allowing for biopsy and histologic confirmation of bladder cancer.",g,g,TRUE,
1073. an 8wk pregnant lady is brough to the ed due to severe vomiting. she was administered iv fluids and oral anti-emetics. she still can’t tolerate anything orally. what is the next best tx?,a. iv feeding,b. iv antiemetics,c. termination of pregnancy,d. ppi,e. iv steroid,,,,,,key: the key is iv antiemetics. [if oral antiemetics are not tolerated iv antiemetics are tried].,"In this scenario, the next best treatment option for the 8-week pregnant woman who is unable to tolerate anything orally despite receiving IV fluids and oral antiemetics would be IV antiemetics. The key highlighted earlier indicates that if oral antiemetics are not tolerated, IV antiemetics are the next option to be considered. IV feeding, termination of pregnancy, PPI and IV steroid are not the recommended options for treating severe vomiting in pregnancy. IV feeding is not the immediate priority as the patient is not suffering from dehydration, which is the primary indication for IV fluids. Termination of pregnancy would only be considered in extreme cases and where the pregnancy would pose a threat to the mother's life. PPI and IV steroids are not generally indicated in the treatment of severe vomiting during pregnancy. Therefore, the best option for this patient would be to explore alternative IV antiemetics to manage the severe vomiting.",b,b,TRUE,
"1074. a 48yo man presents with bone pain. labs: alp=high, phosphate=normal. what is the most likely dx?",a. osteoporosis,b. osteomalacia,c. paget’s disease,d. fx,e. myeloma,,,,,,"key: the key is c. paget’s disease. [bone pain, high alp and normal phosphate are suggestive of pagets disease. in osteoporosis ca+, po4³- and alp are normal. in osteomalacia ca+ low, po4³- low and alp is high. in pagets disease ca+ and po4³- normal and alp markedly raised].","Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for the 48-year-old man with bone pain is Paget's disease (option C). This is because high ALP levels and normal phosphate levels are typical of Paget's disease, while in osteoporosis, calcium, phosphate, and ALP are all normal. In osteomalacia, calcium and phosphate levels are low, while ALP is high. Fractures and myeloma would require further investigation and additional symptoms to diagnose. Therefore, based on the lab results and symptoms provided, Paget's disease is the most likely diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,
1075. a 54yo lady presents with sudden severe pain in the left half of her skull. she also complains of pain around her jaw. what is the most likely next step?,a. ct,b. mri,c. fundoscopy,d. esr,e. temporal artery biopsy,,,,,,key: the key is d. esr. [elderly lady with severe pain in the left half of her skull and pain around jaw is suspicious of giant cell or temporal arteritis. esr if markly raised supports the diagnosis of temporal arteritis].,"The correct answer to the question is d. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) should be the first test to order when suspecting giant cell or temporal arteritis in a patient who presents with sudden severe pain in the left half of her skull and pain around her jaw. A markedly raised ESR would support the diagnosis of temporal arteritis. Ordering a CT or MRI scan at this point would not be helpful unless there were other neurological symptoms or signs. Fundoscopy might reveal changes related to temporal arteritis, but it would not be the initial test of choice. Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not the most likely next step since it is an invasive and expensive procedure. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this scenario would be to order an ESR.",d,d,TRUE,
1076. a 7yo school boy has been dx with meningococcal meningitis. what is the advice for schoolmates and staff?,a. rifampicin for the whole class and family,b. rifampicin for the whole school and family,c. meningococcal vaccine for the family,d. benzylpenicillin,e. iv cefotaxime,,,,,,key: the key is a. rifampicin for the whole class and family. [in contacts of meningococcal meningitis chemoprophylaxis is given with rifampicin].,"The correct answer to the question is A, rifampicin for the whole class and family. This is because meningococcal meningitis is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in close quarters such as a classroom. Rifampicin is an antibiotic that can help prevent the spread of the infection and is recommended for all close contacts of a person diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. Option B, rifampicin for the whole school and family, is incorrect as it is too broad and unnecessary as not everyone in the school may have been in close contact with the infected student. Option C, meningococcal vaccine for the family, is also incorrect as it is a preventive measure and not a treatment option for those who have already been infected. Option D, benzylpenicillin, and option E, iv cefotaxime, are both treatment options for meningococcal meningitis but not preventive measures to stop the spread of the infection. Therefore, the correct advice for schoolmates and staff is to take rifampicin as a preventive measure.",a,a,TRUE,
1077. a pt came with dyskaryosis to the opd. she is a heavy smoker and alcoholic. cervical smear shows abnormal cells. what is the best advice for her?,a. colposcopy,b. biopsy,c. endocervical sample,d. repeat after 4m,e. none,f. cone biopsy,,,,,key: the key is a. colposcopy. [patient with dyscariosis should go for colposcopy].,"The best advice for the patient with dyskaryosis, who is a heavy smoker and alcoholic, is to undergo colposcopy (option A). This is because abnormal cells on a cervical smear can indicate the presence of pre-cancerous or cancerous cells. Colposcopy involves a visual examination of the cervix using a special magnifying tool and a biopsy may be taken if necessary. Biopsy (option B) may be performed during colposcopy if abnormal areas are identified, but it is not the first step. Endocervical sample (option C) is another test that can be done during colposcopy, but it is not the primary recommendation for this scenario. Repeat smear after 4 months (option D) may be necessary in some cases, but since the patient is a heavy smoker and alcoholic, it is important to take prompt action and not follow-up at a later time. Cone biopsy (option F) is a more invasive procedure that is not needed at this stage. Therefore, the best advice is for the patient to undergo colposcopy to determine the extent of abnormal cells and allow for appropriate treatment.",a,a,TRUE,
1078. pt with pain and swelling in left leg and thigh up to the level of inguinal ligament. where is the level of occlusion?,a. femoro-popliteal artery,b. left common iliac artery,c. aortoiliac artery,d. femoral artery,e. profound femoral artery,,,,,,key: there are two keys b. left common iliac artery. and d. femoral artery. correct key is b. left common iliac artery. [general rule is occlusion occurs in proximal bifarcation. so the correct key is b. left common iliac artery. that is occlusion in the bifarcation of left common iliac artery (as femoral artery bifarcates more distally to superficial and deep branches)].,"The correct answer to the question is b. left common iliac artery. This is because occlusion typically occurs at the proximal bifurcation of an artery, which in this case is the left common iliac artery. The femoral artery actually bifurcates more distally into its superficial and deep branches, so it is not the site of occlusion in this scenario. Similarly, the femoro-popliteal artery and the profound femoral artery are also distal branches and not likely to be the site of occlusion. The aortoiliac artery is a possible location for occlusion, but since the pain and swelling are localized to the left leg and thigh up to the level of inguinal ligament, it is more likely that the occlusion is in the left common iliac artery.",b,b,TRUE,
1079. a 65yo man presents with dyspnea 3d after an mi. on auscultation he has a pansystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. what is the most likely dx?,a. ruptured papillary muscle,b. ventricular aneurysm,c. pericarditis,d. pericardial effusion,e. vsd,,,,,,key: the key is a. ruptured papillary muscle. [pansystolic murmur in apex radiating to axilla may be due to mitral regurgitation secondary to papillary muscle rupture].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 65-year-old man presenting with dyspnea three days after an MI and showing a pansystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla is a ruptured papillary muscle (answer A). This is because the rupture of papillary muscle can lead to valvular regurgitation, specifically mitral regurgitation, which causes the pansystolic murmur heard on auscultation. This murmur is characterized by a continuous sound throughout systole, which can be heard over the apex of the heart and can radiate to the axilla. Ventricular aneurysm (answer B), pericarditis (answer C), pericardial effusion (answer D), or VSD (answer E) do not typically produce a pansystolic murmur or the specific distribution heard in this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is A, ruptured papillary muscle.",a,a,TRUE,
"1080. a 64yo man with multiple myeloma has been vomiting since the past 2days. labs: ca2+=3.2mmol/l, k+=5mmol/l, na+=149mmol/l and pcv=55%. what is the most appropriate next step?",a. iv insulin,b. iv calcium gluconate,c. iv fluids,d. iv bisphosphonates,e. oral bisphosphonates,,,,,,key: the key is c. iv fluids. [multiple myeloma itself is a cause of vomiting and also associated hypercalcemia can cause sickness. as the patient is vomiting for 2 days there may be considerable dehydration and also the hypercalcemia needs treatment with iv fluid].,"The most appropriate next step for a 64-year-old man with multiple myeloma who has been vomiting for the past 2 days, and has lab results showing a high calcium level and high hematocrit would be to administer IV fluids. This is because vomiting can lead to dehydration and further complications, and hypercalcemia can also cause illness, which requires treatment with IV fluids. Administering insulin or calcium gluconate would not address the underlying cause of vomiting and hypercalcemia. IV bisphosphonates or oral bisphosphonates may be used to treat hypercalcemia, but in this case, rehydration with IV fluids takes precedence. Therefore, the correct answer is IV fluids.",c,c,TRUE,
"1081. a 30yo man from australia returned from a business trip to indonesia 6d ago presenting with complaints of fever, joint and muscle ache and headache, in particular behind the eye for the past 2 days. what is the most probable dx?",a. malaria,b. chicken pox,c. tb,d. lyme’s disease,e. dengue,,,,,,"key: the key is e. dengue. [fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headache these are common in dengue fever. particularly retro-orbital pain is well recognized feature of dengue fever].","Based on the symptoms described, the most probable diagnosis is dengue fever (option e). Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes that is common in tropical and subtropical climates, including Indonesia. The symptoms of dengue fever include fever, joint and muscle aches, headache, and retro-orbital pain, which is pain behind the eye. Malaria (option a) is another mosquito-borne illness that can cause fever, but it typically presents with other symptoms such as chills and sweats. Chicken pox (option b), TB (option c), and Lyme disease (option d) do not typically present with the symptoms described and are less likely. It is important to note that a proper diagnosis should be made by a healthcare professional and confirmed through testing.",e,e,TRUE,

[viability of the fetus is better assessed with transvaginal us. tvu can be done throught pregnancy. it should be avoided once the membrane is ruptured to avoid chance of fetal infection].,"The correct answer is A, transvaginal ultrasound. This is because the viability of the fetus is better assessed with a transvaginal ultrasound, which is able to provide a clearer image of the fetus and detect any abnormalities or issues. Additionally, transvaginal ultrasound can be safely performed throughout the pregnancy, unlike other options. Serum and urinary beta-hCG levels are not specific to viability and can only indicate the presence of pregnancy, while abdominal ultrasound may not provide accurate results due to the small size of the fetus at 8 weeks. Per speculum exam cannot confirm the viability of the fetus. It is important to note that once the membrane is ruptured, transvaginal ultrasound should be avoided to prevent the chance of fetal infection.",a,a,TRUE,
1083. a 24yo lady has been low after the death of her husband and had stopped contacting her family. she was started on ssri tx and starts feeling better after a few months. on discontinuating the meds she starts feeling that she has developed cancer just like her husband. what is the most appropriate next step?,a. continue ssri,b. add tca,c. neuropsychiatric analysis,d. cbt,e. antipsychotics,,,,,,key: the key is c. neuropsychiatric analysis. this is wrong key. correct key is a. [continue ssri. such stopping of drug is not acceptable. patients treated with fluoxetine for 12 weeks whose depressive symptoms remit should continue treatment with fluoxetine for at least an additional 26 weeks to minimize the risk of relapse].,"The correct answer is A, ""continue ssri."" This is because patients who have been treated with fluoxetine for 12 weeks, whose depressive symptoms have remitted, should continue treatment with fluoxetine for at least an additional 26 weeks to minimize the risk of relapse. Stopping the medication is not recommended as it can lead to a relapse of depressive symptoms. Option B, adding TCA, is not recommended as it can cause serotonin syndrome when combined with an SSRI. Neuropsychiatric analysis (option C) and CBT (option D) may be useful but continuing the SSRI treatment is the priority. Antipsychotics (option E) are not appropriate for this situation as the patient is not experiencing psychotic symptoms. Therefore, the best course of action would be to continue SSRI treatment to prevent relapse of depression.",a,a,TRUE,
1084. a 24yo male who is sexually active with other males with hx of discharge per urethra. dx of chlamydia has been made. what is the possible complication if left untreated?,a. orchitis,b. balanitis,c. epididymo-orchitis,d. acute abdomen,,,,,,,key: the key is c. epididymo-orchitis.,"The correct answer to this question is c. Epididymo-orchitis. If left untreated, chlamydia infection can spread to the epididymis and testicles, causing inflammation known as epididymo-orchitis. This condition can lead to complications such as scarring, infertility, and chronic scrotal pain. Although orchitis (a) and balanitis (b) are also possible complications of untreated chlamydia, they are less common. Acute abdomen (d) is not a likely complication of chlamydia infection. It is important to seek prompt medical treatment for chlamydia to avoid potential complications.",c,c,TRUE,

Social Phobia. Social Phobia, also known as Social Anxiety Disorder, is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and persistent fear or anxiety in social situations where one might be scrutinized, judged, or negatively evaluated by others. The person in the scenario avoids social situations such as restaurants and may not leave the home because of their fear of being talked about by others. This is not indicative of Agoraphobia, which involves fear and avoidance of places or situations where escape might be difficult or panic symptoms might occur. GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) is a condition where someone experiences excessive anxiety and worry about various life events and situations but not necessarily specific to social settings. Panic Disorder involves recurrent panic attacks and fear of having more panic attacks. Adjustment Disorder is typically diagnosed when someone experiences psychological distress in response to a life event or stressor. However, the information given in this scenario does not indicate that a life event or stressor was the cause of the individual's social anxiety. Therefore, social phobia is the most appropriate diagnosis in this scenario.",e,e,TRUE,
"1086. a 63yo man presented with sudden onset of severe dyspnea, orthopnea, raised jvp and bilateral basal crackles 3d after an episode of mi. a dx of acute congestive cardiac failure was made and iv furosemide was started for this pt. what electrolyte abnormality is expected?","a. high na+, low k+","b. low na+, high k+","c. low na+, low k+","d. high na+, high k+","e. low na+, normal k+",,,,,,"key: the key is c. low na+, low k+. [frusemide causes hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia].","The correct answer to the question is c. Low na+, low k+ as frusemide, which is a loop diuretic medication commonly used to treat acute congestive cardiac failure, causes hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and several other electrolyte imbalances. Hyponatremia occurs due to increased excretion of sodium in the urine, while hypokalemia results from increased excretion of potassium. Therefore, the patient is expected to experience low levels of both sodium and potassium. None of the other choices are correct as they contradict the effects of frusemide on electrolyte balance. Choice a, high na+, low k+ is incorrect because frusemide leads to reduced levels of both sodium and potassium, while choice b, low na+, high k+ is incorrect because frusemide leads to increased excretion of potassium, not retention. Choice d, high na+, high k+ is incorrect because frusemide causes a decrease in both sodium and potassium, and choice e, low na+, normal k+ is also incorrect because frusemide leads to reduced levels of both sodium and potassium.",c,c,TRUE,
1087. a 70yo hypertensive white british man on thiazide diuretics needs a 2nd drug to control his bp. which one of the following is the best choice for him?,a. amlodipine (ccb),b. enapril (acei),c. propranolol (bb),d. increase dose of diuretic,e. prazocin (alpha blocker),,,,,,"key: the key is b. enalapril. [in patients >55 yrs ccb. if ccb not suitable (oedema, heart failure) thiazide is preferred. in patients <55yrs acei or arb. now if patient is on ccb or thiazide and 2nd drug is to be added it should be one of acei or arb and not one from ccb or thiazide].","In a 70-year-old hypertensive white British man on thiazide diuretics, the best choice for a second drug to control his blood pressure would be enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. In patients over the age of 55, a calcium channel blocker (CCB) is typically the preferred choice for a second drug. However, if the patient is unable to take a CCB due to side effects such as edema or heart failure, a thiazide diuretic can be used instead. In patients under the age of 55, an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is the preferred second drug. If a patient is already on a CCB or thiazide diuretic and a second drug is needed, it should be an ACE inhibitor or ARB, not another CCB or thiazide diuretic. Therefore, options a, c, d, and e are not the best choices for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,
1088. a 74yo lady who has had a stroke in the past has an indwelling catheter for 10m. she presents with bluish-purple discoloration of the catheter bag. what is the most likely explanation for this?,a. normal change,b. catheter degradation,c. acidic urine,d. alkaline urine,e. bacterial colonization of the urinary tract,,,,,,key: the key is e. bacterial colonization of the urinary tract. [purple urine bag syndrome].,"The correct answer is e, bacterial colonization of the urinary tract. This condition is known as purple urine bag syndrome, in which there is an overgrowth of certain bacteria that produce a purple pigment. This is more commonly seen in elderly patients with long-term indwelling catheters, as these are more prone to bacterial colonization. Options a and b are unlikely as normal changes and catheter degradation do not result in a purple discoloration. Option c, acidic urine, can cause red or pink discoloration but not purple. Option d, alkaline urine, can cause a foul odor but not purple discoloration. Therefore, the correct answer is e, bacterial colonization of the urinary tract.",e,e,TRUE,
1089. a 62yo man has slow palpitations and the following ecg. what is the most likely dx?,a. sinus bradycardia,b. 1st degree heart block,c. mobitz type 1 block,d. mobitz type 2 block,e. complete heart block,,,,,,key: the key is c. mobitz type 1 block. [gradual prolongation of pr interval followed by a drop beat].,"Based on the given ECG, the most likely diagnosis for the 62-year-old man with slow palpitations is c. Mobitz type 1 block. This is identified by a gradual prolongation of the PR interval followed by a dropped beat, which is visible in the ECG. Sinus bradycardia and 1st degree heart block are unlikely as the ECG shows evidence of a block. Mobitz type 2 block and complete heart block can also be ruled out as there is not a complete cessation of conduction between the atria and ventricles. Therefore, Mobitz type 1 block is the most likely diagnosis, as it is characterized by irregular conduction between the atria and ventricles, resulting in a dropped beat.",c,c,TRUE,
"1090. a 29yo woman presents with lid lag, lid retraction and diplopia. what is the most appropriate next step?",a. tft,b. tensilon test,c. fundoscopy,d. autoantibodies,e. emg,,,,,,key: the key is a. tft. [features are suggestive of grave’s disease hence tft].,"The correct answer is A, TFT (thyroid function test). The patient's symptoms are suggestive of hyperthyroidism, specifically Graves' disease, which should be confirmed with a thyroid function test. The symptoms of Graves' disease are distinct, including lid lag, lid retraction, and diplopia, and can be confirmed through laboratory testing. The other choices are not appropriate next steps as they do not directly address the suspicion of Graves' disease. The tensilon test and EMG are used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms. Fundoscopy is used to examine the eye's retina, while autoantibodies testing would be a second-line test for Graves' disease after TFTs are performed. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this patient's management is to perform a TFT to confirm the diagnosis of Graves' disease.",a,a,TRUE,
1091. a 41yo man presents with longstanding foul smelling ear discharge and progressive hearing loss. otoscopy showed perforation of the pars flacida and a mass in the upper part of the middle ear. what is the most likely dx?,a. asom,b. csom,c. acquired cholesteatoma,d. congenital cholesteatoma,e. barotrauma,,,,,,key: the key is c. acquired cholesteatoma. [in congenital cholesteatoma there is usually no perforation. in acquired cholesteatoma perforation is in pars flaccida].,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is c. acquired cholesteatoma. This is because the patient presents with longstanding foul smelling ear discharge and progressive hearing loss, which are common symptoms of cholesteatoma. Otoscopy showed a perforation of the pars flacida and a mass in the upper part of the middle ear, which is indicative of acquired cholesteatoma. It is important to note that in congenital cholesteatoma, there is usually no perforation, making options d and e incorrect. Asom (acute suppurative otitis media) typically presents with acute onset of symptoms such as pain, fever, and hearing loss, while csom (chronic suppurative otitis media) is characterized by a long-standing ear discharge without any evidence of cholesteatoma. Therefore, b and a are both unlikely diagnoses in this case.",c,c,TRUE,
1092. a 9yo child presented with a rash on his skin which didn’t respond to antibacterial ointment. what med should be added next?,a. corticosteroid,b. antifungal,c. emollient,d. permethrin,e. coal tar,,,,,,key: the key is b. antifungal. [if a lesion is suspected to be infected should be given antibiotic. but if no response next step is to add an antifungal].,"In this scenario, the correct answer is b. antifungal. A 9-year-old child presented with a rash on his skin that did not respond to antibacterial ointment. The next step would be to add an antifungal medication, as the rash may be fungal in nature. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, not fungal infections. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and do not address the underlying infection. Emollients are used to moisturize the skin and may not be effective in treating a skin infection. Permethrin is used to treat lice and scabies, not fungal infections. Coal tar is used to treat psoriasis and other skin conditions, but is not effective for fungal infections. It is important to correctly identify the cause of the infection in order to choose the appropriate treatment.",b,b,TRUE,
"1093. a young boy has a hx of epistaxis. cbc=normal, except aptt=47s. what is the most likely dx?",a. hemophilia,b. itp,c. sickle cell,d. hus,e. thalassaemia,,,,,,key: the key is a. hemophilia. [a young boy with epistaxis and prolonged aptt is a probable case of hemophilia. factor viii and ix should be offerred to confirm the diagnosis].,"The correct answer is a. Hemophilia. This is because a prolonged aptt (activated partial thromboplastin time) is a common feature of hemophilia. Epistaxis (nosebleed) is also a common symptom of hemophilia, especially in younger patients. Confirmatory tests for the diagnosis of hemophilia include checking factor VIII and IX levels, which are often deficient in hemophilia patients. The other answer choices, such as ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura), sickle cell disease, HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome), and thalassemia, are less likely diagnoses in this case, as they typically present with different symptoms and laboratory findings.",a,a,TRUE,
1094. a 29yo young man presents with complaints of recurrent attacks of diarrhea. he says his stools contain blood and mucos. sometimes he has low grade fever. what is the most appropriate inv for his condition?,a. stool culture,b. plain abdominal xr,c. per rectal exam,d. barium enema,,,,,,,"key: the key is d. barium enema. [features are suggestive of ibd, so barium enema is the most relevant investigation among the given options].","The most appropriate investigation for this 29-year-old man with recurrent diarrhea containing blood and mucus, along with a low-grade fever, is a barium enema. This is because the features of his symptoms suggest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A barium enema can help to visualize abnormalities in the large intestine and identify signs of IBD, such as ulcers, strictures, and inflammation. Stool culture may be used to identify infectious causes of diarrhea, but it is less likely in this case since the symptoms have been recurrent. A plain abdominal x-ray and per rectal exam are not as specific or sensitive as a barium enema in identifying signs of IBD. Therefore, the most relevant and appropriate option among the choices given is a barium enema.",d,d,TRUE,
1095. a 26yo young man presents with hx of passing loose stools for the past 2m. he says his stools contain blood and mucus and are a/w abdominal pain. he undergoes a colonscopy after which he was started on tx. what is the most appropriate tx for his condition?,a. mesalazine,b. corticosteroids,c. infliximab,d. cyclosporine,,,,,,,key: the key is a. mesalazine. [features and tx after colonoscopy suggests dx of ulcerative colitis for which initial treatment option is mesalazine].,"The correct answer is a. Mesalazine, which is a first-line treatment option for ulcerative colitis. The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings suggest a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, characterized by bloody and mucousy stools and abdominal pain. Mesalazine, which belongs to the class of aminosalicylates, is commonly used to treat this condition as it targets inflammation in the colon. Corticosteroids such as b, and immunosuppressants such as c and d, are typically reserved for more severe cases or when other treatments have failed. Therefore, mesalazine is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition based on the given information.",a,a,TRUE,
1096. a 52 yo male with poorly controlled dm has now presented to his gp with pain in the ear. exam: skin around the ear is black in color and there was foul smelling discharge from the ear. pt also had conductive hearing loss. what is the most probable dx?,a. carbuncle,b. folliculitis,c. malignant oe,d. cholesteatoma,e. furuncle,,,,,,"key: the key is c. malignant oe. [in some cases, otitis externa can spread to the outer ear and surrounding tissue, including the bones of the jaw and face. this infection is known as malignant otitis externa. thogh the term malignant is used it is not a cancer].","The most probable diagnosis for a 52-year-old male with poorly controlled DM, presenting with ear pain, black skin around the ear, foul-smelling discharge from the ear and conductive hearing loss is C, malignant OE. This diagnosis is likely due to the progression of otitis externa where the infection spreads beyond the outer ear, often affecting the jaw and face. While the term ""malignant"" is misleading, it does not necessarily indicate cancer. Choices A, B, D, and E are less likely diagnoses and do not fit with the symptoms presented. Carbuncles and furuncles involve the hair follicles and do not typically affect the ear. Cholesteatomas involve abnormal skin growth in the middle ear and not the outer ear. Therefore, malignant OE is the most probable diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,

[following mi at least 6 months should be elapsed for elective operation. prior this time surgery is associated with increased mortality].,"The correct answer is E - MI 2 months ago. It is recommended that at least 6 months should elapse before undergoing elective surgery after a myocardial infarction, as prior to this time it is associated with increased mortality. Controlled asthma and controlled atrial fibrillation are not indications for delaying elective herniorrhaphy. A history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 2 years ago does not necessarily require a delay in herniorrhaphy, as long as appropriate prophylaxis measures are taken to prevent DVT recurrence. A diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90mmHg is not a contraindication for surgery, although efforts should be made to bring it down to acceptable levels to reduce the risk of perioperative complications.",e,e,TRUE,

The clinical features of obesity, facial hair growth, and amenorrhea are consistent with PCOS. In addition, the LH (luteinizing hormone) to FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 in PCOS is seen in this case with an elevated LH level of 33.2 and normal FSH level of 10.9. Pregnancy can be ruled out as the patient has a history of amenorrhea and the hormonal levels are not consistent with pregnancy. Cushing's disease is unlikely as there are no symptoms of hypercortisolism. CAH (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) is also unlikely as progesterone levels are normal.

This is because the described lump is most likely a fibroadenoma, which is a common benign breast tumor in young women. For women under 35 years old, the recommended next step is an ultrasound (us breast) to confirm the diagnosis and assess the characteristics of the lump. CT (a type of imaging test that uses X-rays) is not typically used for breast evaluation, and a punch biopsy (removal of a small tissue sample) or stereotactic biopsy (removal of a larger tissue sample guided by imaging) may be necessary if the ultrasound findings are concerning. However, reassurance and sending the patient home without further investigation is not appropriate without first ruling out a potentially dangerous condition, and may cause unnecessary anxiety for the patient and her family.",b,b,TRUE,

PID or pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the female reproductive organs that can lead to fever, lower abdominal pain and vaginal discharge, which are all symptoms that the patient is exhibiting. Acute appendicitis, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy and UTI are all differential diagnoses, but given the patient's symptoms and history, acute PID is the most suitable diagnosis. Acute appendicitis is unlikely as the pain is usually located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, while endometriosis may cause pain but not fever or vaginal discharge. Ectopic pregnancy may cause lower abdominal pain but is usually associated with amenorrhea, and UTI may cause fever and pain, but not vaginal discharge. Therefore, acute PID is the most likely and most suitable diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

[ fsh and lh are raised in ovarian failure; an fsh level ≥20 iu/l in a woman aged around 40 with secondary amenorrhoea indicates ovarian failure. in pof there is also a mild to moderate rise in prolactin].,"Based on the given information, the most appropriate diagnosis for the 40-year-old female is e. premature ovarian failure. Premature ovarian failure is characterized by raised levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and a mild to moderate increase in prolactin. In this case, the woman has an FSH level of 22 and an LH level of 24, which indicates ovarian failure. The fact that she stopped taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) 6 months ago suggests that the cessation of hormonal contraception is not the cause of her amenorrhea. Pregnancy (choice d) can be ruled out as her estradiol level is not suggestive of pregnancy. Hypothalamic amenorrhea (choice a) is a common cause of amenorrhea, but the raised FSH and LH levels argue against it. Prolactinoma (choice c) would present with markedly elevated prolactin levels, usually greater than 1000 ng/mL, which are not seen in this case. Therefore, premature ovarian failure is the most appropriate diagnosis based on the laboratory values provided.",e,e,TRUE,

This method is preferred because it is accurate and does not involve surgery. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is not appropriate because it has already been performed and was inconclusive. MRI is not necessary at this stage, as the lump is suspicious but not conclusive for breast cancer. Punch biopsy is not as accurate as a core biopsy and may miss important features to provide a definitive diagnosis. Genetic testing and counseling are not necessary for a single lump and usually reserved for high-risk individuals or those with a family history of breast cancer. Therefore, a core biopsy is the most appropriate investigation in this scenario.",e,e,TRUE,

[post pill amenorrhea= failure to resume menses within 6 months of stopping pill, she was amenorrheic for 12 months].","The correct answer is D, post pill amenorrhea. Post pill amenorrhea is defined as a failure to resume menstrual cycles within six months of stopping oral contraceptives. In this case, the patient had amenorrhea for 12 months, which fulfills the criteria for post pill amenorrhea. The elevated levels of FSH and LH suggest that there is no suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, ruling out hypothalamic amenorrhea. The high levels of estradiol indicate that there is adequate ovarian function, thus excluding premature ovarian failure. PCOS and prolactinoma can also cause amenorrhea, but the laboratory results are not consistent with these conditions. Overall, the patient's symptoms and lab results support a diagnosis of post pill amenorrhea.",d,d,TRUE,

Although genetic testing and counseling may be important for asymptomatic patients in their 30s, it is not the appropriate next step for this patient who has a firm breast lump and a family history of breast cancer. Both mammography and ultrasound may be used in conjunction with core biopsy to help diagnose breast cancer, but neither of these options alone can definitively confirm or rule out cancer. In this case, the patient's location of the lump in the outer quadrant, borderline benign changes on the FNAC, and high risk for breast cancer suggest that a core biopsy is necessary to confirm whether or not cancer is present.

[in mild dyscariosis colposcopy should be done with hpv test].,"The most appropriate next step for a patient with mild dyskaryosis and a normal smear test one year ago is to undergo colposcopy with HPV testing. This option is the correct answer because mild dyskaryosis may indicate pre-cancerous changes in the cells of the cervix, and colposcopy with HPV testing can help identify these changes and determine the appropriate course of action. Repeat smear and swab and culture are not recommended as they may not provide enough information to properly assess the status of the cervix. Cauterization and cone biopsy are more invasive procedures and are typically only performed if more advanced pre-cancerous changes are found.",e,e,TRUE,

[regular heavy menstruation in a uterus of 14 wk size is highly suggestive of fibroid].,"The most appropriate diagnosis for an African lady presenting with regular but heavy periods and a uterus size of 14 weeks pregnancy is fibroids. This is because regular heavy menstruation is highly suggestive of fibroids, which are noncancerous growths that develop in or around the uterus. Blood dyscrasia, hematoma, adenomyosis, and incomplete abortion are unlikely explanations for the patient's symptoms. Blood dyscrasia refers to abnormalities in blood cells or platelets, which are unlikely to cause heavy periods alone. Hematoma, or a collection of blood outside a blood vessel, is not typically associated with heavy periods. Adenomyosis refers to the growth of endometrial tissue into the muscular layer of the uterus, but usually causes irregular, painful periods rather than heavy ones. Incomplete abortion, or products of conception remaining in the uterus after a miscarriage, would present with abnormal bleeding in addition to heavy periods. Therefore, fibroids are the most likely explanation for the presented symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[ultrasonogram scan can detect placental abrubtion and fetal heart beat as well. so it is the preferred key over ctg].,"The correct answer to this question is a. ultrasonogram scan (uss). The patient is presenting with constant abdominal pain and passing 100ml of blood per vagina. These symptoms suggest a possible placental abruption which can be detected through an uss. An uss can also detect the fetal heart rate, which is important in determining the wellbeing of the fetus. The other options, such as ctg (cardiotocography), clotting screen, hgb (hemoglobin), and kleihauer betke test, are not the appropriate initial investigations for this patient's presentation. Ctgs are used to monitor fetal heart rates in pregnancy, but an uss is more appropriate in this case. Clotting screens and hbgs may be performed later on, if necessary, but do not address the immediate concern of possible placental abruption. The kleihauer betke test is used to calculate the amount of fetal blood in the maternal circulation, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation. Therefore, an uss is the preferred initial investigation in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

[in hytaditidiform mole uterus becomes more in size than actual gestational age and due to production of large amount of gonadotrophin by moles patient suffers from severe vomiting i.e. hyperemesis. there also occurs vaginal bleeding].,"The most probable diagnosis for this 26-year-old woman with amenorrhea, hyperemesis, and now vaginal bleeding is e. molar pregnancy. This is because a hydatidiform mole can cause the uterus to increase in size more than the actual gestational age, leading to the appearance of a 16-week uterus in this case. Additionally, the mole produces large amounts of gonadotrophin, which can cause severe vomiting or hyperemesis and also lead to vaginal bleeding. Thyrotoxicosis and hyperemesis gravidarum are both possible causes of hyperemesis, but they don't explain the enlarged uterus or vaginal bleeding. Twins or wrong dates might also explain the enlarged uterus, but they wouldn't account for the hyperemesis and vaginal bleeding. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a molar pregnancy.",e,e,TRUE,

[hyperemesis gravidarum with oliguria and ketonuria. iv fluid should be started to prevent renal failure].,"The correct answer is E. IV fluids. The pregnant woman in question is presenting with hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition characterized by severe vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. The presence of oliguria and ketonuria is a concerning sign that renal failure may be imminent if proper intervention is not taken. As such, the next best step in the management of this condition would be to start IV fluids to restore fluid and electrolyte balance. Option A, ultrasound, would not provide any immediate benefit for the patient and is not a priority at this time. Option B, oral fluid replacement, would not be sufficient in managing the significant dehydration that the patient is experiencing. Option C, serum bhcg, is not relevant in the management of hyperemesis gravidarum. Option D, parental anti-emetics, may provide relief from the vomiting but would not address the underlying dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the best course of action would be to begin IV fluids to prevent renal failure and provide the patient with the necessary hydration and electrolytes needed for a healthy pregnancy.",e,e,TRUE,

[ref: samson notes].,"Based on the given information, the correct answer is a) repeat smear in 6 months. The inflammatory changes seen on the cervical smear might be due to a variety of causes including infection or irritation. However, since there is no indication of any other symptoms like vaginal discharge, pelvic pain or fever, it is more likely that the changes are due to a non-infectious cause. Therefore, it is recommended to repeat the smear in 6 months to monitor if the changes persist or resolve on their own. Choice b) take swab is a wrong key given in the question. It is not necessary to take a swab unless there is suspicion of an infection. Choice c) treat with antibiotics is also not appropriate as there are no indications of an infection. d) Colposcopy or e) Cone biopsy are invasive procedures that are only needed if the repeat smear shows further abnormalities. Therefore, the correct answer is a) repeat smear in 6 months.",a,a,TRUE,

While clomiphene therapy can be helpful in inducing ovulation and improving fertility, it is not effective in treating fibroids. IVF may be an option in some cases, but with the presence of fibroids, the success rate of IVF may be compromised. Hysterectomy is not a suitable option for a young woman who wants to conceive, as it involves the removal of the uterus. IUI (intrauterine insemination) is not a preferred option in the presence of fibroids as they may interfere with the implantation of the fertilized egg. Therefore, myomectomy is the most suitable option to remove the fibroids and improve the chances of getting pregnant.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the man has primary infertility and azoospermia, which could be indicative of a chromosomal abnormality such as Klinefelter's syndrome. Karyotyping is the definitive test for diagnosing such chromosomal abnormalities. The other options listed, including testosterone, LSH, FSH and Estradiol, are hormonal tests that may be helpful in evaluating other aspects of male infertility but are not specific to diagnosing chromosomal abnormalities.

It was previously thought that antibiotics could reduce the potency of cocp by altering gut flora and affecting the metabolism of ethinyloestradiol, leading to a risk of pregnancy and breakthrough bleeding. However, it has now been established that except for strong enzyme inducers like rifampicin and rifabutin, other antibiotics do not significantly reduce the efficacy of cocp. Therefore, for a course of 7-day antibiotics, additional precautions such as backup contraception with condoms are not necessary.

HRT, or hormone replacement therapy, as it is widely used to treat the symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes and night sweats. HRT replaces the hormones that the body no longer produces after menopause. Raloxifene (a) is a medication used for osteoporosis prevention and treatment, while bisphosphonates (c) are used to treat and prevent osteoporosis. COCP (d), or combined oral contraceptive pills, are used for birth control but cannot treat menopausal symptoms. Topical estrogen (e) can also relieve menopausal symptoms, but it is less effective than HRT. Therefore, HRT is the most appropriate treatment option for controlling menopausal symptoms.

[according to nice, cut offs for iron supplements: at booking (8-10 weeks)- if less than 11 at 28 weeks and further- if less than 10.5 if less than these values=> give iron].","The correct answer is C, ferrous sulphate. The woman's hemoglobin level of 10.6 indicates anemia, which is most likely due to a physiologic hemodynamic anemia that occurs during pregnancy. The increase in plasma volume during pregnancy leads to a dilution of red blood cells, resulting in lower hemoglobin levels. The MCV of 95 and MCHC of 350 suggest that this anemia is microcytic and hypochromic, which is consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Given the patient's gestational age and hemoglobin level, she meets the criteria for iron supplementation according to NICE guidelines. Folate (A) is indicated for megaloblastic anemia, which is not suggested by the patient's results. Dextran (B) is a blood volume expander and is not indicated for treatment of anemia. IV FeSO4 (E) and blood transfusions (G) are reserved for severe cases of anemia, which is not suggested by the patient's results.

Eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy-induced hypertension characterized by the onset of seizures, usually within 24 hours of delivery, and often within 12 hours. The fact that the patient had no history of seizures or high blood pressure before delivery supports this diagnosis. Epilepsy, on the other hand, is a chronic condition that typically manifests with recurrent seizures, making it less likely in this case. Pulmonary embolism and pregnancy-induced hypertension do not typically present with seizures. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a. eclampsia.",a,a,TRUE,

Mirena. This contraceptive is an intrauterine device (IUD) that releases a small amount of the hormone progestin, which helps to thin the lining of the uterus and reduce menstrual flow. Mirena is an effective and long-term contraceptive option that can last for up to 5 years. Options a, b, and d are hormonal contraceptives that may worsen the patient's heavy periods and painful cramps. Option c, Implanon, is a subdermal contraceptive that may not be suitable for the patient given her previous c-section. Option f, IUCD, is another type of contraceptive that can be effective for up to 10 years, but may not be the best choice for the patient as it can also worsen heavy periods and cramps.

The correct answer to this question is c. endocervical swab, not b. cervical smear. While a cervical smear could be used to detect abnormalities, it is not the best initial test for detecting intermenstrual bleeding. In contrast, an endocervical swab is more appropriate for evaluating intermenstrual bleeding. Additionally, conducting a smear can only be done if it is due or overdue, not in any time or not as needed basis. In this case, the patient's next smear will not be due for another two years.

The presence of a complex cystic 7cm mass in the left adnexa and severe abdominal pain with fever are indicative of an inflammatory mass. Endometriosis and dermoid cysts are less likely because they do not typically present with severe pain and fever. Ovarian cancer is also less likely in a 20-year-old, and would require further imaging studies to confirm. Ectopic pregnancy is typically associated with missed menstrual periods and vaginal bleeding, which are not present in this case.

[amniocentesis is done between 14 to 16 weeks of gestation. cvs is done prior to 15 weeks. so the option is a. amniocentesis].,"The correct answer to this question is a. amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is a test that can detect abnormal chromosomal anomalies in a developing fetus. It is done between 14 to 16 weeks of gestation, making it the definitive invasive test at this stage of pregnancy. CVS, on the other hand, is done prior to 15 weeks of gestation. Parent karyotyping, Coomb’s test, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are all not definitive invasions at this stage. Amniocentesis is a more accurate test than CVS because it provides a larger sample of amniotic fluid for testing purposes. Therefore, if a woman is 16 weeks pregnant and is worried about abnormal chromosomal anomalies in her child, the best course of action is to undergo an amniocentesis test.",a,a,TRUE,

[patient is not yet pregnant but planning for pregnancy.  earliest possible diagnostic test for cf is pre-implantation genetic dx. preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is a procedure used prior to implantation to help identify genetic defects within embryos created through in vitro fertilization to prevent certain diseases or disorders from being passed on to the child].,"For a 28-year-old woman with a family history of cystic fibrosis planning for pregnancy and seeking the earliest possible diagnostic test, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is the most suitable option. PGD is a test used prior to implantation to identify genetic defects within embryos created through in vitro fertilization to avoid passing on certain disorders or diseases to the child. This method allows for the selection of embryos that do not carry the disease-causing gene, preventing the need for termination. CVS and amniocentesis may be useful later in the pregnancy to confirm the diagnosis, but they are invasive procedures and carry a higher risk of complication. Chromosomal karyotyping and maternal serum testing are not useful for CF diagnosis. Therefore, PGD is the most suitable and ethical option for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the patient's lab values suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation, with low fibrinogen levels, prolonged aptt, and pt. The low platelet count and elevated bilirubin levels are also indicators of DIC. Pregnancy-induced hypertension and HELLP syndrome may present with elevated liver enzymes, which are not seen in this case. Acute fatty liver and obstetric cholestasis are also unlikely as they do not typically present with acute abdominal pain in late pregnancy. Overall, the presenting symptoms and lab values suggest DIC as the cause of the patient's acute abdominal pain.",b,b,TRUE,
"1125. a 36wk pregnant woman presents with sudden onset of uterine pain and bleeding, uterus is tender, no prv lscs. what is the most appropriate cause?",a. preeclampsia,b. dic,c. placental abruption,d. placental previa,e. ectopic pregnancy,f. missed abortion,g. ectropion,,,,key: the key is c. placental abruption. [painful bleeding at 36th week is placental abruption (either revealed or mixed type)].,"The correct answer is c. The key symptom that points towards placental abruption is sudden onset uterine pain and bleeding along with tenderness of the uterus. Placenta previa (choice d) typically presents with painless vaginal bleeding and no tenderness of uterus. Ectopic pregnancy (choice e) presents with sharp pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. Missed abortion (choice f) is a miscarriage with no external bleeding or cervical dilation. Ectropion (choice g) does not cause bleeding in pregnant women. Preeclampsia (choice a) may cause hypertension, proteinuria, and edema but does not cause uterine pain or bleeding. Therefore, the correct answer is c – placental abruption.",c,c,TRUE,
1126. a 28wk pregnant woman presents with uterine bleeding after sexual intercourse. what is the most appropriate cause?,a. preeclampsia,b. dic,c. placental abruption,d. placental previa,e. ectopic pregnancy,f. missed abortion,g. ectropion,,,,key: the key is g. ectropion. [post coital bleeding can be either placenta previa or cervical ectropion. but as ectropion is commoner in pregnancy so it is the option here].,"In this scenario, the most appropriate cause of uterine bleeding after sexual intercourse in a 28-week pregnant woman would be g. ectropion. Ectropion is a condition in which the cells from the inside of the cervix grow outside and become exposed on the surface. This condition is common in pregnancy and can cause irregular bleeding, especially after sexual intercourse. While placenta previa can also cause post-coital bleeding, ectropion is the more likely option given the patient's gestational age. The other choices, including preeclampsia, DIC, placental abruption, ectopic pregnancy, and missed abortion are less likely to be the cause of post-coital bleeding at this stage of pregnancy. Therefore, ectropion is the most appropriate option given the patient presentation.",g,g,TRUE,

[h/o pid is a recognized cause of ectopic pregnancy. also pain without bleeding at 6th week support the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 6-week pregnant woman who presents with abdominal pain and a history of PID is an ectopic pregnancy. This is because PID can cause scarring in the fallopian tubes, which can result in the fertilized egg implanting outside the uterus, leading to an ectopic pregnancy. Additionally, the presence of pain without bleeding at 6 weeks supports the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Preeclampsia, DIC, placental abruption, placental previa, missed abortion, and ectropion are less likely diagnoses in this scenario and can be ruled out based on the given information.",e,e,TRUE,
"1128. a 33wk pregnant woman presents with vaginal bleeding, low hgb, low plt, increased bilirubin, ast normal, aptt & pt increased. what is the most likely dx?",a. preeclampsia,b. dic,c. placental abruption,d. placental previa,e. ectopic pregnancy,f. missed abortion,g. ectropion,,,,key: the key is b. dic.,"The correct answer is B, DIC or Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation. DIC is a pathological condition where the body’s coagulation system becomes excessively activated, leading to both clotting and bleeding. In this scenario, the patient’s presentation suggests DIC due to the presence of diffuse bleeding symptoms (vaginal bleeding), decreased levels of platelets (low plt), increased bilirubin levels, and prolonged coagulation times (increased aptt and pt). Preeclampsia (answer A) is a condition characterized by high blood pressure in pregnant women and may be associated with proteinuria (protein in the urine) and edema; however, it is not commonly associated with bleeding or coagulation dysfunction. Placental abruption (answer C) is a separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, which can result in vaginal bleeding, but it typically does not cause coagulation abnormalities. Placenta previa (answer D) is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix, leading to bleeding, but it does not typically affect coagulation. Ectopic pregnancy, missed abortion, and ectropion (answers E, F, and G) are also unlikely to cause abnormal coagulation parameters. Therefore, DIC is the most likely diagnosis in this case, and prompt intervention is necessary to prevent complications.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because preeclampsia is a serious medical condition that is characterized by high blood pressure (≥140/90mmHg) and proteinuria (≥300mg/dL), which typically occurs after 20 weeks of gestation. Moreover, preeclampsia can also cause organ damage and fetal complications if left untreated. On the other hand, the other choices are less likely because essential hypertension is usually diagnosed before pregnancy, gestational hypertension is a milder form of preeclampsia without proteinuria, and chronic hypertension is characterized by sustained high blood pressure before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation. Hence, it is essential to diagnose and manage preeclampsia early to prevent adverse outcomes for both the mother and the unborn baby.",d,d,TRUE,

[patient of antiphospholipid syndrome had 3 fetal losses and no thromboembolic event and now wants to be pregnant. in such case prophylactic treatment with low dose aspirin is indicated].,"The correct answer for the next pregnancy of a 32-year-old woman with a history of spontaneous abortions would be (b) aspirin. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a potential cause of recurrent pregnancy loss, particularly in women with a history of fetal losses occurring at less than 10 weeks of gestation. A prophylactic treatment with low-dose aspirin is recommended for such cases. (a) MgSO4 is used to prevent seizures in women with preeclampsia or eclampsia, (c) warfarin and (d) mefenamic acid are contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal malformations and bleeding, respectively.

[there are some precipitating factors of hemolysis causing jaundice in patients with g6pd deficiency among which infection is a recognized one].,"The correct answer is b. G6PD deficiency. This is because G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder that leads to the breakdown of red blood cells under certain conditions, such as infections, causing jaundice in affected individuals. The other choices are incorrect because they do not typically present with recurrent jaundice brought about by infections. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal red blood cells to break down prematurely, leading to anemia, but it does not typically present with jaundice brought about by infections. Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, but it does not typically present with jaundice brought about by infections. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal red blood cells to have a sickle shape, leading to anemia and other complications, but it does not typically present with recurrent jaundice brought about by infections. Congenital storage disorders are a group of genetic disorders that affect the metabolism of certain substances within the body, but they do not typically present with jaundice brought about by infections.",b,b,TRUE,

Tranexemic acid. This medication helps to decrease bleeding by preventing blood clots from breaking down. It is the most appropriate treatment for a woman who presents with heavy bleeding during her menstrual cycle. The other choices are not as effective. COCP or combined oral contraceptive pills can regulate menstrual cycles, but they have potential side effects, such as blood clots, especially in women who are over 35 and smoke. Mefenamic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can reduce menstrual pain, but it does not treat heavy bleeding. IUCD or intrauterine contraceptive device can also cause heavy bleeding in some women. Norethisterone is a hormone that can be used to treat heavy bleeding, but it can cause side effects such as breast tenderness, mood changes, and irregular menstrual cycles. Therefore, in this case, tranexemic acid is the most appropriate treatment option for a woman who smokes and presents with heavy bleeding and prolonged menstrual periods.",d,d,TRUE,

Cocp has been seen to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce blood loss. Option A, mefenamic acid, can only provide temporary relief from cramps and does not address irregular periods or heavy blood loss. Option C, pop (progestogen-only pills), can help with irregular periods but may not be effective in reducing heavy blood loss. Option D, iucd (intrauterine contraceptive device), can also help with heavy blood loss but may not regulate irregular menstrual cycles. Option E, mirena, is a type of iucd and may have similar limitations as iucd. However, it is important to note that before prescribing cocp, the contraindications must be evaluated to ensure the safety of the patient.

The patient's presentation suggests she may have simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, which requires high-dose progestogens for treatment. The most effective way to deliver this is through the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS), which is the Mirena device. Mefenamic acid and contraceptive pills (COC and POP) are not appropriate treatments for this condition.

This procedure is suitable for dealing with both subserosal and intramural fibroids, which is the case for this patient. Hysteroscopic myomectomy is suitable for mainly submucosal fibroids only, while UAE is not recommended for women who still want to conceive. Vaginal hysterectomy and abdominal hysterectomy are more invasive options that may be considered only when necessary. Therefore, based on the patient's age and desire for future fertility, abdominal myomectomy would be the most appropriate treatment option.",e,e,TRUE,

Methadone is an opioid medication that helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms in people addicted to heroin or other narcotic drugs, without causing the ""high"" associated with the drug addiction. It is often used as part of a treatment program to help individuals quit drug addiction. Benzodiazepines (a) are not commonly used to treat drug addiction and may actually increase the risk of overdose. Diazepam (b) is a benzodiazepine used primarily for anxiety disorders and alcohol withdrawal. Lithium (c) is used to treat bipolar disorder and should not be used to treat drug addiction.

The bluish discoloration of the hands in cold temperatures is a result of Raynaud’s phenomenon, which causes blood vessels in the extremities to narrow, reducing blood flow and causing the skin to turn blue. The reddish spots on the body are likely telangiectasia, which are small dilated blood vessels under the skin. Symmetrical peripheral arthropathy also suggests a rheumatic disease, which is often associated with systemic sclerosis.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that typically presents with pain and stiffness in the affected joint, which worsens as the day progresses. In addition, the nodules in her hands, known as Hebden or Bouchard's nodes, are often a characteristic feature of osteoarthritis. The anemia found in the patient is most likely secondary to prolonged use of NSAIDs for pain management. Rheumatoid arthritis (answer a) usually presents with joint swelling, fever, and prolonged morning stiffness. Gout (answer c) and pseudogout (answer d) present with acute arthritis flares, not a gradual onset like in osteoarthritis.

Thiazide diuretics, commonly used in the treatment of heart failure, may cause an increase in uric acid levels in the blood leading to gout. The joint fluid can show uric acid crystals which can confirm the diagnosis of gout. X-ray of bone (A) is not typically used to diagnose gout, and plasma RF (B) may be elevated in several autoimmune disorders but is not specific for gout.

[in those with unexplained liver disease with or without respiratory symptoms should be evaluated for aatd].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 7-year-old presenting with chronic cough and found to be jaundiced on exam is e. alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. This is because alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause both liver disease and respiratory symptoms such as chronic coughing. It is important to evaluate patients with unexplained liver disease with or without respiratory symptoms for AATD. The other choices, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, bronchiolitis, and RDS, do not typically present with jaundice and are not associated with AATD. Therefore, AATD should be considered as the most likely diagnosis in this case.",e,e,TRUE,

The patient's blood tests suggest renal failure with hyperkalemia, which can cause life-threatening arrhythmias. To prevent this, potassium must be shifted into the cells. Administering insulin with dextrose infusion will help to do this. Calcium resonium enema (option B) is used for hyperkalemia, but is not the immediate management for the patient's condition. Bolus of 20u insulin (option A) can cause a sudden drop in blood sugar levels, leading to hypoglycemia. Dextrose-saline infusion (option C) and 5% dextrose infusion (option D) could worsen the patient's hyperkalemia by providing more potassium. Therefore, option E is the most appropriate immediate management.",e,e,TRUE,

[herpes simplex virus causes multiple painful vesicles and syphilis ulcer is painless. as here single painful ulcer probable dx is chancroid caused by hemophilus ducreyi].,"The correct answer is c. A swab for Hemophilus ducreyi should be done in a 25-year-old woman who presents with a painful shallow ulcer on the vulva because this presentation is suggestive of chancroid, which is caused by Hemophilus ducreyi. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes multiple painful vesicles, while syphilis ulcer is painless. Therefore, choices a and b are incorrect. Urine culture and blood culture are also irrelevant as they do not help in the diagnosis of chancroid. In summary, a swab for Hemophilus ducreyi is the most appropriate investigation to be done in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,

[please consider dx of impetigo if specifically mention honey (or yellow or golden) coloured lesion or distribution described to be on face and limbs predominately. otherwise consider chickenpox. though key is impetigo here, it is wrong key. likely correct option here is varicella].","It is likely that the correct answer to this question is a. varicella, rather than b. impetigo. Even though honey or yellow colored lesions on the face and limbs can be indicative of impetigo, the generalized nature of the skin lesions and presence of weeping and crusted lesions suggests that the child is experiencing a viral infection like varicella (chickenpox). Options c, d, and e are less probable as they do not typically present with the same symptoms as described in the question stem. In summary, the most probable diagnosis based on the given information is varicella.",b,b,TRUE,

[mikulicz’s disease (md) is a well-known disorder characterized by enlarged lacrimal and parotid glands caused by infiltration with lymphocytes. when no specific cause is found it is called mikulicz’s disease; and if secondary to disease like sarcoidosis it is termed as mikulicz’s syndrome].,"The most probable diagnosis for the patient with a 6-month history of painless bilateral swelling of the face and perihilar lymphadenopathy on routine CXR is e. Mikulicz's disease. Mikulicz's disease is a disorder characterized by enlarged lacrimal and parotid glands caused by infiltration with lymphocytes. It is often referred to as a syndrome when there is an underlying disease like sarcoidosis. The other answer choices are unlikely given the patient's presentation. Chronic sialadenitis usually presents with localized pain and swelling. Thyroid adenoma would not typically present with facial swelling. Carcinoma of the salivary gland would present with unilateral rather than bilateral swelling, and adenoid cystic carcinoma typically has a slow-growing mass rather than bilateral swelling. Therefore, e. Mikulicz's disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.",e,e,TRUE,

[in female breast and lung cancer and in male prostate and lung cancer are most common to metastasize to bone].,"The correct answer is e. breast. Common cancers that metastasize to the bone include breast and lung cancer in females and prostate and lung cancer in males. Since the woman presented with severe back pain, it's likely that the cancer has spread to the bones, which is often indicative of advanced stage disease. The other options are less likely as they don't commonly metastasize to the bone. Cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancers typically spread to nearby organs and lymph nodes, and lung cancer typically spreads to other parts of the lung, liver, or brain.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because OM with effusion is a common cause of hearing loss in children. In addition, the symptoms of increased TV volume suggest that the child is having difficulty hearing. Options A and B (wax and foreign body) may cause temporary hearing loss but not progressive hearing loss. Option D (SNHL) is unlikely due to the sudden onset of symptoms, and option E (meningitis) is less likely since the child has a normal examination. Therefore, bilateral OM with effusion is the most likely diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,
1155. a child had a patchy rash following tx for sore throat & cervical ln enlargement. which is the most appropriate antibiotic?,a. ampicillin,b. erythromycin,c. cefuroxime,d. metronidazole,e. tetracycline,,,,,,key: the key is a. ampicillin. [infectious mononeucleosis can present with sorethroat and lymphadenothy like tonsillitis and if treated with ampicillin leads to eruption of patchy rashes].,"The correct answer is a. Ampicillin. This is because the scenario presented is suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, which can present with symptoms such as sore throat and cervical lymphadenopathy, similar to those observed in tonsillitis. However, if ampicillin is used to treat infectious mononucleosis, it can lead to the development of a patchy rash. The other choices, such as erythromycin, cefuroxime, metronidazole, and tetracycline, are not appropriate for the treatment of infectious mononucleosis and may not address the root cause of the rash. Therefore, ampicillin is the most appropriate antibiotic to use in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

[nsaids including ibuprofen can precipitate asthma and cocodamol is also advised to avoid in asthma (due to its codeine content). so paracetamol is the best option here].,"The best analgesic for a child with a history of asthma who has a cut on their knee and a sprained wrist is paracetamol. NSAIDs including ibuprofen are not recommended for individuals with asthma because they can cause asthma to worsen. Additionally, cocodamol contains codeine which is also not recommended for individuals with asthma. Therefore, paracetamol is the safest and most appropriate option in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

[asthma and bronchiolitis has similar sign symptoms. the difference is in pathology. in asthma there is bronchoconstriction but in bronchiolitis there is oedema of the airway wall. in infants and younger children bronchiolitis is commoner than asthma and it is seen that many of the children with bronhiolitis usually followed by asthma].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 15-month-old baby girl in the ED with difficulty breathing, intercostal recessions, and wheezing is c. bronchiolitis. Although asthma and bronchiolitis share similar signs and symptoms, the difference between them lies in the pathology. Asthma is characterized by bronchoconstriction, while bronchiolitis involves edema of the airway walls. Bronchiolitis is more common in infants and younger children, and it is often followed by asthma. The other choices, such as a. URTI (upper respiratory tract infection), b. pneumonia, d. RDS (respiratory distress syndrome), and e. alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, can be ruled out because they do not fit with the presenting symptoms of the patient.",c,c,TRUE,

[this is complex partial seizure due to space occupying lesion].,"The most probable diagnosis for the 8-year-old boy in this scenario is b. space occupying lesion. This is because the patient experienced a seizure affecting only one side of his body and the CT scan revealed a lesion in the left hemisphere of his brain. Epilepsy is a possibility, but the unilateral nature of the seizure and the presence of a lesion make it less likely. Dementia and Huntington’s chorea are both unlikely as they are progressive conditions that usually do not present with sudden onset seizures. Similarly, intracranial hypertension is unlikely as it usually presents with symptoms such as headaches and visual changes, rather than seizures. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient’s seizure is a space occupying lesion.",b,b,TRUE,

[dysphagia to both solid and liquid or mostly to liquid are common feature of achalasia. in achalasia there may occur aspiration due to regurgitation during lying down to sleep which may result recurrent chest infection and cough].,"The most probable diagnosis for a 28-year-old female presenting with difficulties in swallowing only liquids and recurrent chest infections is achalasia cardia (option C). Dysphagia to both solid and liquid is a common feature of achalasia. In this condition, there may be regurgitation during lying down to sleep, which can lead to aspiration, resulting in recurrent chest infections and cough. Options A, B, D, and E are less likely because they do not typically present with only difficulty swallowing liquids and recurrent chest infections. Foreign body usually causes acute symptoms, Plummer Vinson syndrome causes dysphagia to solids and liquids, peptic stricture and esophageal carcinoma typically present with progressive dysphagia to solids and later to liquids. Therefore, achalasia cardia is the most probable diagnosis for this patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
1160. mother having 2 children with cf. what is the risk of getting another baby?,a. 1:2,b. 1:8,c. 1:4,d. 1:16,e. 1:1,,,,,,key: the key is c. 1:4. [cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease. if both parents are carrier there is 1:4 chance of risk of occurrence of the disease for each child].,"The correct answer is c, 1:4. This is because cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, meaning that both parents must be carriers of the defective gene for the disease to occur in their children. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy that their child will inherit two copies of the defective gene and therefore have cystic fibrosis. Since the mother already has two children with cystic fibrosis, this means that both parents must be carriers of the defective gene. Therefore, the risk of having another child with cystic fibrosis is still 1:4, or 25%. The other answer choices are incorrect as they do not take into account the fact that both parents are carriers of the disease-causing gene.",c,c,TRUE,
"1161. a 14yo boy has been dx with nephrotic syndrome. 5d later he presents with flank pain, hematuria and fluctuating urea levels. a dx of renal vein thrombosis is made. what is the most likely cause for renal vein thrombosis?",a. protein c deficiency,b. vasculitis,c. loss of antithrombin iii,d. high estrogen levels,e. stasis,,,,,,key: the key is c. loss of antithrombin iii.,"The correct answer is c, loss of antithrombin III. Nephrotic syndrome is known to cause loss of antithrombin III, which is responsible for regulating blood clotting. As a result, patients with nephrotic syndrome are at an increased risk of developing blood clots, such as renal vein thrombosis. Protein C deficiency and high estrogen levels are also known risk factors for blood clots, but they are less likely causes in this scenario. Vasculitis and stasis are not commonly associated with renal vein thrombosis in the absence of other risk factors. Therefore, loss of antithrombin III is the most likely cause of renal vein thrombosis in this 14-year-old boy with nephrotic syndrome.",c,c,TRUE,
"1162. a 36yo woman presented with massive bleeding from multiple sites. lab: fibrin degradation products: +++, plt=30, bleeding time=prolonged, pt=prolonged, aptt=prolonged. what is the most likely dx?",a. hemophilia,b. dic,c. itp,d. factor v leiden,e. warfarin,,,,,,key: the key is b. dic.,"The correct answer is b) DIC or disseminated intravascular coagulation. DIC occurs when there is abnormal blood clotting in small blood vessels which can lead to organ damage due to lack of blood flow, and at the same time, there is also bleeding due to consumption of clotting factors. The presentation given in the question, with prolonged bleeding time, low platelets, and prolonged clotting times, are all characteristic of DIC. Hemophilia, ITP, and factor V Leiden do not present with the same constellation of lab findings and symptoms as DIC. Warfarin use can lead to bleeding, but the lab findings in the question do not suggest the use of warfarin. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is DIC.",b,b,TRUE,

[a cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period (e.g., are born, are exposed to a drug or vaccine or pollutant, or undergo a certain medical procedure].","The correct answer is c. cohort study. This study involved a group of people (cancer patients) who shared a common characteristic (treated for cancer) within a defined period (the study period). This study is classified as a cohort study because it followed the same group of patients in two different hospitals and recorded the outcome, which was mortality rate. A retrospective study involves looking back at previous data, which is not the case in this scenario. An observational study involves observing and recording data without interfering with the subject, which is not accurate in this case because treatment was given to the cancer patients. A case study is an in-depth analysis of an individual or a small group of individuals, which is not the case for this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is c. cohort study because it involved a group of people with a common characteristic within a defined period, and recorded an outcome to compare between two different hospitals.",c,c,TRUE,

[the time required for the egg to travel to the uterus and implant is usually between 7 and 10 days]. [there are two types of pill: 1. 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel pill. it should be taken within 72 hours (three days). it is thought to work mainly by preventing or delaying the release of an egg from your ovary, which normally happens each month (ovulation). 2. ulipristal acetate (brand name ellaone®) is a type of emergency contraceptive pill that was launched in the uk in 2009. it is taken as one single tablet. take the pill as soon as possible after unprotected sex. the earlier you take the pill, the more effective it is. it can be taken up to 120 hours (five days) after having unprotected sex. it is a type of hormone which seems to work by stopping or delaying release of an egg (ovulation). iucd prevent implantation. as she is sexually active hymen is ruptured and iucd can be given to her. but with iucd chance of ectopic pregnancy is much more!].","The correct answer is A - it helps to prevent implantation. The prescribed procedure referred to in this question is likely the use of emergency contraception, which can prevent pregnancy if taken within a certain time frame after unprotected sex. Option B is incorrect as it describes regular birth control pills and not emergency contraception. Option C is incorrect, as emergency contraception does not cause an early miscarriage. Option D is also incorrect as it refers to regular birth control pills and not emergency contraception. Option E is not a valid answer as it is incomplete and lacks information. Implantation is the process by which a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus and begins to grow. Emergency contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill or the copper intrauterine device (IUD), works primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation, but can also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. This information is important for the patient to know in order to understand how the procedure works and make informed decisions about their reproductive health.",a,a,TRUE,

[a baer (brainstem auditory evoked response) test can help to diagnose hearing loss and nervous system disorders, especially in newborns, young children, and others who may not be able to participate in a standard hearing test].","The most appropriate test for a 2nd baby whose mother has a history of conductive hearing loss is a brain stem evoked response (BAER) test, which can help to diagnose hearing loss and nervous system disorders, especially in newborns, young children, and others who may not be able to participate in a standard hearing test. The BAER test is a non-invasive and painless procedure that measures the electrical activity of the auditory nerve and brainstem in response to sound. This test is highly sensitive in detecting hearing loss, and it is particularly useful in infants because they are unable to respond to sounds in the way that older children or adults can. CT, MRI, and the fork test are not appropriate tests for diagnosing hearing loss, and reassurance alone may not address the mother's concerns about her baby's hearing. Therefore, the correct answer is A, brain stem evoked response.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because with proper and complete treatment, such as antibiotics for meningitis, the boy's body will be able to fight off the infection and any associated complications. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they are potential complications of untreated or inadequately treated meningitis, but with full treatment, they should not occur. Hearing impairment can result from meningitis if the infection spreads to the inner ear, brain abscess can occur if the infection spreads to the brain tissue, and encephalitis is a rare complication where the brain itself becomes inflamed. However, with proper treatment, these complications should not arise and a full recovery is expected.",a,a,TRUE,

[though biliary infection is possible but acute pancreatitis is more common complication of ercp and absence of any obstruction (stone or tumour which helps biliary infection to occur) makes cholangitis less likely].,"Based on the given information, the possible cause of the patient's complaints is acute pancreatitis, as it is a more common complication of ERCP and can present with symptoms like jaundice, fever, and upper abdominal pain within 24 hours. Biliary infection is also a possible cause, but the absence of any obstruction (stone or tumor), which helps biliary infection to occur, makes cholangitis less likely. Perforation is not likely as the cholangiography was done and found to be patent. Therefore, based on the given information, the correct answer is option B, acute pancreatitis, while options A and C are less likely to be the cause of the patient's complaints.",b,b,TRUE,

The child's ABG profile is likely to show a high pH and high pCO2 due to prolonged vomiting which causes loss of H+ and leads to metabolic alkalosis. To compensate for this alkalosis, the lungs will retain carbon dioxide through slower breathing, or hypoventilation, resulting in an increased pCO2 level. Option a is incorrect as a low pH and low pCO2 indicates respiratory acidosis which is not likely in this case. Option b is also incorrect as a low pH and high pCO2 indicates respiratory failure which is not the case here. Option c is incorrect as metabolic alkalosis leads to a high pH and low pCO2, but compensation in this scenario occurs through hyperventilation, leading to a decreased pCO2.",d,d,TRUE,

This 68-year-old woman is presenting with symptoms suggestive of psychotic depression, which is a severe form of depression that occurs when a person has depression along with psychosis. In this case, the patient has suicidal ideation and delusions that people are out to kill her. Antidepressants alone may not be effective in treating psychotic depression. Instead, antipsychotics are often prescribed as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy to target psychotic symptoms. CBT and interpersonal therapy may be helpful in the management of depression, but they are not the first-line treatments for psychotic depression. ECT may also be an option, especially if the patient does not respond to medication, or if her condition is life-threatening. However, considering the severity of her symptoms and the fact that she is not responding to antidepressants, adding antipsychotics would be the most appropriate treatment for her at this time.",e,e,TRUE,

[probable delirium tremens].,"The correct answer to the question is diazepam. The patient's symptoms of agitation, aggression, and confusion after a hernioplasty procedure are suggestive of probable delirium tremens. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can help manage the symptoms of delirium tremens. Chlordiazepoxide, the initially suggested key, is not an appropriate choice as it has a longer half-life and can accumulate in elderly patients leading to adverse effects. Vit B and thiamine may be beneficial for alcoholic patients, but they do not directly address the patient's symptoms. Clozapine, an antipsychotic medication, is not appropriate for the management of delirium tremens. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is diazepam.",a,a,TRUE,

The patient presents with neurological symptoms, specifically sudden loss of vision, which cannot be explained by any organic cause. It is believed that these symptoms arise in response to a stressful or emotional situation affecting the patient's mental health. The patient witnessed a tragic event and was unable to sleep the night after, which indicates psychological distress. The other choices are incorrect because somatization involves multiple physical symptoms, PTSD involves symptoms related to trauma exposure, dissociation involves a detachment from reality, and GAD involves excessive worry and anxiety about daily life events.",a,a,TRUE,

[patient was in step 1. as not controlled next step is addition of inhaled corticosteroid].,"Based on the patient's worsening symptoms and increased need for salbutamol, the next step in management would be to add an inhaled corticosteroid. Choices a, d and e are not appropriate as they do not address the underlying inflammation causing the patient's symptoms. Prednisolone is a systemic corticosteroid and would be reserved for severe exacerbations or if the patient does not respond to inhaled corticosteroids. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist and would be used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma. Choice b is incorrect as it provides short-acting relief only, whereas inhaled beclomethasone in choice c, works to reduce inflammation over time. Therefore, the correct answer is c, beclomethasone inhaled.",c,c,TRUE,

[as mesothelioma poorly responds to chemo and radiotherapy and recurrent effusion causes distressing symptoms chest drain is the most appropriate measure.  as there occurs repeated effusion so thoracocentasis is not appropriate but chest drain].,"The most appropriate management for a 64-year-old man with mesothelioma who presents with weight loss and chest pain and develops shortness of breath and a pleural effusion on X-ray is B) chest drain. This is because mesothelioma poorly responds to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and recurrent effusion can cause distressing symptoms. Thoracocentesis is not appropriate in this case, as repeated effusion is likely and chest drain is a more effective method of drainage. Pneumonectomy is not necessary for the management of mesothelioma unless there is extensive disease, and even then, the benefits of the surgery may not outweigh the risks. Therefore, the most appropriate management in this case is chest drain.",b,b,TRUE,

If the patient is symptomatic with polyuria and polydipsia, insulin or a secretagogue like sulfonylurea would be preferred. However, if the patient is not symptomatic, lifestyle modification should be the first step. The answer choice (a) of ACEI and sulfonylurea is not correct because sulfonylurea is not always appropriate for an elderly patient. The other answer choices (b, c, and e) are not appropriate because they do not address the primary issue of elevated blood sugar levels.

Impaired glucose tolerance is defined by the World Health Organization as having a blood glucose level of 7.8 mmol/l or more but less than 11.1mmol/l after a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test. In this case, the patient's blood glucose level was 10mmol/l after the two-hour test, which falls within the range for impaired glucose tolerance. The other answer choices are incorrect because impaired fasting glucose (b) is defined as a fasting blood glucose level of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/l, and neither type 1 diabetes (c) nor type 2 diabetes (d) can be diagnosed by a single blood glucose test. Metabolic syndrome (e) is a collection of risk factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease but is not related to the specific blood glucose levels presented in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, ACE inhibitors have renoprotective effects, which can benefit patients with diabetes and hypertension who are at an increased risk of developing kidney disease. Diuretics are typically used in patients with hypertension and/or heart failure to reduce edema and fluid overload, but they do not have the same cardiovascular protective benefits as ACE inhibitors. Insulin is used in patients with diabetes to lower blood sugar levels, but it is not a first-line medication for hypertension or cardiovascular risk reduction. Beta blockers are indicated in patients with hypertension, but they are not recommended as first-line therapy in patients without a history of heart failure or coronary artery disease. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are indicated in patients with hypertension, but they do not provide the same cardiovascular protective effects as ACE inhibitors and are not recommended as first-line therapy in patients with a history of myocardial infarction.",a,a,TRUE,

[among ssris sertraline is the drug of choice in mi patient. if ssri cannot be used mirtazapine is recommended as next antidepressant].,"The correct answer for the best medication treatment for a 57-year-old man with moderate depression following a recent myocardial infarction is a. SSRI. In this case, among SSRI drugs, sertraline is the drug of choice. This is because it has been shown to be effective in managing depression in patients with prior heart attack with fewer side effects compared to other classes of antidepressants. The other choices listed are not appropriate for this patient. TCAs have an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and anticholinergic side effects, MAOIs can cause hypertensive crisis when combined with medications that contain tyramine (common in foods), benzodiazepines are not effective in treating depression as they are merely anti-anxiety medications, and mood stabilizers are typically used to manage bipolar disorder, not depression.",a,a,TRUE,

[the case may be either pneumothorax or massive pleural effusion. thoracocentasis is recommended for both].,"The correct answer is b. Needle thoracocentesis. The presented case suggests a possible pneumothorax or massive pleural effusion that could be causing the patient's chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension, dilated neck veins, and trachea deviation. As such, the next appropriate management would be needle thoracocentesis to decompress the pleural space and improve the patient's hemodynamics. Portable XR (a) may help diagnose the cause of the symptoms, but would not address the patient's hemodynamic instability. Chest drainage (c) may be necessary if the pleural effusion is large, but it is a more invasive procedure that may not be immediately feasible given the patient's clinical presentation. ABG (d) and CTPA (e) may also be useful in the diagnostic process, but are not the next appropriate management for this urgent scenario.",b,b,TRUE,

Blood tests and throat swabs are not reliable methods for diagnosing TB. The Mantoux test can identify exposure to TB but cannot distinguish between active and latent infections. CSF testing is not routinely done for TB. Therefore, gastric washing is the best option as it can detect the presence of TB bacteria in the stomach contents.",c,c,TRUE,
1181. a 51yo man had a mi a few days ago. he developed breathlessness. echo was done and showed a pansystolic murmur. what can be the cause of this symptom?,a. ruptured papillary muscle,b. acute pericarditis,c. dresslers syndrome,d. malignant vt,e. ventricular aneurysm,,,,,,key: the key is a. ruptured papillary muscle. [papillary muscle rupture causes mitral regurgitation causing pancystolic murmur leading to features of heart failure like breathlessness].,"A 51 year old man presenting with breathlessness after a recent MI has been found to have a pansystolic murmur on echo. The most likely cause of this is a ruptured papillary muscle, leading to mitral regurgitation and resulting in symptoms of heart failure like breathlessness. Acute pericarditis, Dressler's syndrome, malignant VT and ventricular aneurysm are unlikely causes of these symptoms as they would not typically present with a pansystolic murmur. Therefore, the correct answer is a. ruptured papillary muscle.",a,a,TRUE,

[in this high level of potassium we have to shift this potassium into cells to reduce plasma level and save heart from arrest or life threatening arrhythmia. for keep the heart safe option of first choice in such emergency is iv calcium gluconate! however it does not shift or reduce potassium level but protects heart from arrhythmia and buy time for definitive measure to take place!].,"In a 61-year-old man presenting with a potassium level of 7.5 and a prolonged QRS complex on ECG, the best possible treatment option would be IV calcium gluconate. This is because in cases of high potassium levels, it is crucial to shift the potassium into cells to reduce the plasma level and protect the heart from life-threatening arrhythmias. IV calcium gluconate serves as the first choice in such emergencies as it protects the heart from arrhythmia and buys time for definitive measures to be taken. While dialysis (option A) can help remove excess potassium, it is not the best immediate option in this scenario. IV insulin and dextrose (option C) may help lower potassium levels but can be risky in a patient with cardiac instability. Salbutamol nebulizer (option D) and loop diuretics (option E) are not effective in treating a high potassium level and prolonging QT interval. Therefore, the most suitable option would be IV calcium gluconate, while keeping in mind the need for further interventions to reduce the potassium level.",b,b,TRUE,

[cellulitis is usually caused by bacteria, such as staphylococci or streptococci that are commonly present on the skin. so penicillin + flucloxacillin should be given].","The correct answer for this case is a. penicillin + flucloxacillin. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection caused by Staphylococci or Streptococci commonly present on the skin. Therefore, the first choice of treatment should be antibiotics targeting these specific bacteria. Penicillin and flucloxacillin have shown to be effective in treating cellulitis caused by these bacteria. The other choices are wrong because they either do not cover the bacteria causing cellulitis or are not the first-line treatment for the disease. Metronidazole and erythromycin (choice b) do not cover Staphylococci or Streptococci, which are the most common causes of cellulitis. Vancomycin and metronidazole (choice c) are typically reserved for more severe infections or when the patient is allergic to penicillin. Ceftriaxone and terbinafine (choice d) do not cover Staphylococci or Streptococci, and terbinafine is not an antibiotic. Ceftriaxone and flucloxacillin (choice e) do not cover Streptococci, which is a common cause of cellulitis.",a,a,TRUE,

This is indicated by the ""NSTE"" in the provided key. An NSTE-ACS event occurs when there is a partial blockage in one or more of the coronary arteries leading to a decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle. The resulting ECG (electrocardiogram) in this case shows no significant ST-segment changes suggestive of a full-blown heart attack (MI), which rules out options a, b, c, and d. Therefore, the answer is e - NSTEMI. It is important to note that NSTE-ACS can still be a life-threatening condition requiring prompt medical attention, and further diagnostic tests such as cardiac enzyme analysis and angiography may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",e,e,TRUE,

[in bipolar disorder there is depressive disorder alternate with mania and the present case is in manic stage of bipolar disorder].,"The correct answer is c. bipolar affective disorder. This woman is exhibiting symptoms of a manic episode, including increased spending, impulsivity, and grandiosity. Additionally, her history of low mood at 12 years old suggests a potential history of depressive episodes, which are often present in bipolar disorder. Options b, d, and e do not fully encompass the symptomatology present in the case, and do not take into account the potential for alternate episodes of depression and mania. Therefore, the correct answer is c. bipolar affective disorder.",c,c,TRUE,

[cough, fever, night sweat and weight loss are very suggestive of tb. so we should do afb as her next investigation].","The correct answer is a. afb. This homeless lady's presentation, with cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and an opacity on CXR, is highly suggestive of tuberculosis. AFB testing (acid-fast bacilli) is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing TB. The test can be done on sputum, bronchoscopy samples, or other body fluids and identifies the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. The Mantoux test (choice b) is a skin test used to detect a previous TB infection and is not useful in diagnosing active TB. Both IFN gamma testing (choice c) and CT scans (choice e) can be used as aids in the diagnosis of TB, but are not the first-line diagnostic tool. Bronchoscopy (choice d) may be useful in obtaining a sample for AFB testing, but it is a more invasive procedure than obtaining sputum. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in investigating this lady's symptoms is to perform AFB testing.",a,a,TRUE,

[features are suggestive of sle. so most appropriate investigation from the given options is a. anti ds dna].,"In this case, the most appropriate investigation would be to perform an anti ds DNA test, option A. The features described in the patient are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. The presence of a malar rash with sparing of nasolabial fold, along with malaise, fatigue, and fever, all point towards a possible SLE diagnosis. Anti ds DNA antibodies are commonly seen in SLE patients and are considered a sensitive and specific marker of the disease. Therefore, option A is the correct choice. Anti histone (option B), anti centromere (option C), anti jo (option D), and anti scl70 (option E) tests are associated with other autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis and polymyositis, but they are not specific for SLE. Hence, they are not appropriate investigations in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

[h/o back pain with presence of plasma cells on inv. are highly suggestive of multiple myeloma].,"The correct answer is a. multiple myeloma. The presence of plasma cells on investigation, along with a history of back pain, is highly suggestive of this condition. Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that occurs when plasma cells in the bone marrow grow out of control and form tumors. The other options are less likely given the provided information. AS (ankylosing spondylitis) is a type of arthritis affecting the spine that doesn't typically present with plasma cells. Disc prolapse is a common cause of back pain, but it's unlikely to be associated with the presence of plasma cells. Leukemia and myelofibrosis are also types of blood cancer, but they typically do not present with the presence of plasma cells. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis, given the information provided, is multiple myeloma.",a,a,TRUE,

[munchausen syndrome is a psychiatric factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves].","The correct answer for this question is E, Munchausen syndrome. Munchausen syndrome is a psychiatric factitious disorder in which individuals feign or exaggerate illness to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. In this case, the patient is exhibiting symptoms of abdominal pain and blood in stool but there are no physical abnormalities found through urine and blood tests. Despite this, the patient insists on getting further investigations. The multiple scars on the abdomen consistent with laparoscopies and appendectomy are suggestive of previous surgeries which may have been unnecessary or done to fulfill the patient's need for attention. Malingering, somatization, hypochondriasis, and conversion disorder are all differential diagnoses for Munchausen syndrome but do not fully encompass the patient's behavior and history in this case.",e,e,TRUE,

[delusions of guilt or sin (self-accusation): this type of delusions involve feeling guilty or remorseful for no valid reason.  an example would be someone that believes they were responsible for a war in another country or hurricane damage in another state.  in this case, the person believes that they deserve to be punished for their sins and place full blame on themselves].","The correct answer is c. guilt. This woman is experiencing delusions of guilt or sin, in which she feels guilty for an event that she had no actual involvement in. This can manifest in the belief that one deserves to be punished for their supposed sins, as in this case where the woman contacts the police to take responsibility for a disaster she could not have caused. Persecutory delusions would involve the belief that others are out to harm the person, poverty delusions involve the belief that one is financially destitute despite evidence to the contrary, nihilistic delusions involve the belief that existence is meaningless or that the world is ending, and reference delusions involve the belief that events or objects have special significance to oneself. Therefore, none of those other answer choices are fitting for the described scenario.",c,c,TRUE,

[flight of idea, elation, over activity and disinhibition are features of mania and low mood, lack of energy and social withdrawal are features of depression. alternating mood swings with depression and mania are chracteristic of bipolar disorder].","The correct answer is a. bipolar affective disorder. This is because the patient is exhibiting symptoms that are characteristic of both depression and mania, which are the hallmark features of bipolar disorder. The symptoms of mania, such as flight of ideas, elation, over activity and disinhibition, are alternated with symptoms of depression, like low mood, lack of energy and social withdrawal. Dysthymia and cyclothymia are also mood disorders, but they do not involve the extreme mood swings seen in bipolar disorder. Mania and hypomania are both types of bipolar disorder, but they do not include the depressive symptoms seen in this patient. Therefore, bipolar affective disorder is the most probable diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.",a,a,TRUE,

It is known that the parents are both carriers of the autosomal recessive disease cystic fibrosis since they have a child with the disease and they themselves are healthy. Based on this, the chances of the third child being a carrier can be calculated using the mode of inheritance. There is a 1:4 chance of the child inheriting two copies of the mutated gene and having cystic fibrosis, a 1:4 chance of being completely healthy and not being a carrier, and a 1:2 chance of inheriting one copy of the mutated gene and being a carrier like their parents. Therefore, the probability of the child being a carrier is 1:2, making option B the correct answer. Options A, D, and E are incorrect since they do not take into account the fact that the parents are carriers, and option C is incorrect as it is not a possible answer based on the inheritance pattern of the disease.",b,b,TRUE,

Delusions of reference occur when a neutral event is believed to have a special and personal meaning. In this case, the man believes that a female newscaster turning a page is a message meant specifically for him. This is a common delusion in schizophrenia. Persecutory delusions involve the belief that someone is out to harm the individual, control delusions involve the belief that an outside force is controlling the individual, grandeur delusions involve the belief that the individual has extraordinary abilities or importance, and nihilistic delusions involve the belief that something important does not exist or has been destroyed. None of these options accurately describe the man's delusion, making e the correct answer.",e,e,TRUE,

The immediate management for a patient with anaphylaxis presenting with stridor, wheeze, and erythematous rash is to give 0.25ml in 1000u epinephrine im. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis because it acts quickly to counteract the effects of the allergen on the body. Checking airway patency and preparing for intubation may be necessary in severe cases, but giving epinephrine is the priority in this situation. Chlorpheniramine and hydrocortisone may also be administered, but they are not the immediate management required for a patient with anaphylaxis. Obtaining secure IV access may be necessary, but it is not the single immediate management required in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is b because it addresses the immediate life-threatening symptoms and provides rapid relief.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because treatment of carcinoma can predispose to the development of oesophageal candidiasis, which is effectively treated with oral fluconazole. The dosage recommended is 200-400mg daily for 14 to 21 days. If needed, intravenous fluconazole can also be given. The other choices, including nystatin suspension, amphotericin B IV, cotrimazole, and analgesics, are not effective in the treatment of oesophageal candidiasis and are therefore not the best possible treatment options.",c,c,TRUE,

This is a type of delusional disorder characterized by the irrational belief that one's partner is unfaithful, despite lacking evidence or proof. Fregoli syndrome, Cotard syndrome, Mood disorder, and Ekbom syndrome are all inappropriate choices, as they present with different symptoms and do not match the delusion of infidelity that is a hallmark feature of Othello syndrome. The husband's claim of being followed by a private detective suggests that the wife's delusions are causing considerable strain on their marriage, emphasizing the need for professional intervention and support.",e,e,TRUE,

[thiazide diuretic is associated with orthostatic hypotension].,"The correct answer to the question is a. orthostatic hypotension. Thiazide diuretics are known to cause a decrease in blood pressure when standing up, thus leading to orthostatic hypotension. This condition can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting, which may result in falls. TIA (transient ischemic attack) and epilepsy do not typically present with symptoms of falls in the morning. Therefore, they are not the most likely cause in this particular case.",a,a,TRUE,

This option is the best choice because a partial thickness burn requires immediate specialized medical attention. This kind of burn involves the destruction of the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin, causing significant pain and risk of infection. Therefore, it is essential to refer the patient to a burn unit where they can receive specialized care such as pain management, wound care, and antibiotics. Options a, b, c, and d are not appropriate because they do not address the underlying issue of a partial thickness burn, and may even worsen it by causing further injury or infection.

SVT is characterized by a rapid and regular heart rate above 150 bpm originating from above the ventricles. The patient's pulse rate of 170 bpm and regularity strongly support the diagnosis of SVT. Other options such as vf (ventricular fibrillation) and vt (ventricular tachycardia) are less likely as they present with rapid but irregular heartbeats and are associated with hemodynamic instability. V-ectopics (ventricular ectopic beats) can cause palpitations but are not associated with regular tachycardia and unlikely to persist for 2 hours. Atrial fibrillation (a-fib) can cause palpitations but is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm and would not explain the regular pulse rate of 170 bpm in this patient.",a,a,TRUE,

[prolonged neonatal jaundice is a well known feature of hypothyroidism].,"The correct answer is b, prolonged neonatal jaundice. This is because prolonged neonatal jaundice is a well-known feature of hypothyroidism. This occurs due to the decreased production of bilirubin, which is responsible for the yellowing of the skin and eyes. Microglossia (a small tongue), undescended testis, anal tag, and left soft palate are not clinical features typically associated with hypothyroidism. Overall, it is important to recognize the clinical features of hypothyroidism in order to ensure timely diagnosis and management of the condition.",b,b,TRUE,

Infants and children who have had a lower urinary tract infection should undergo ultrasound within 6 weeks, especially if they are younger than 6 months or have had recurrent infections. This is done to exclude vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) which is a common cause of recurrent UTIs. Choice b) IVU, c) CT kidney, d) BUE, and e) MCUG are not appropriate next investigations for a 2-week-old girl with confirmed E.coli UTI. IVU and CT are associated with radiation exposure and not routinely indicated for UTIs. BUE (bottom-up excretory urography) is rarely performed and not indicated in this case. And, MCUG (micturating cystourethrogram) is typically reserved for children with a high clinical suspicion of VUR or abnormal ultrasound findings. Therefore, in this case, the most appropriate next investigation is ultrasound.",a,a,TRUE,

[central caseous necrosis with sourrounded fibrosis is diagnostic of tb lymphadenitis. the most common cellular components seen are epithelioid cell clusters. lymphocytes and langhans giant cells].,"The most probable diagnosis for the lady from Asia with a lump in her neck containing caseous material in the center surrounded by fibrosis is tb lymphadenitis, which is diagnostic of tuberculosis. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of cellular components such as epithelioid cell clusters, lymphocytes, and langhans giant cells. The other choices are unlikely because thyroid carcinoma, lymphoma, inf. mono, and mesothelioma do not typically present with caseous necrosis or fibrosis, nor do they exhibit the aforementioned cellular components. Therefore, based on the presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is tb lymphadenitis.",b,b,TRUE,
1203. a 32yo woman has undergone a biopsy for a breast lump. the report says: a well circumscribed lump with clear margins and separated from the surrounding fatty tissue. what is the most appropriate interpretation of this report?,a. fibroadenosis,b. ca breast,c. mammary abscess,d. fibroadenoma,e. fat necrosis,,,,,,"key: the key is d. fibroadenoma. [fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumor of the female breast. white , well-circumscribed mass is clearly demarcated from the surrounding yellow adipose tissue].","The correct answer is d. fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumors of the female breast. They typically present as well-circumscribed masses with clear margins, separated from the surrounding fatty tissue. This description matches the report of the woman's biopsy results. Fibroadenosis, or fibrocystic changes, is a non-tumor-related condition that can cause breast lumps and tenderness but does not present as a clearly defined mass. Ca breast, or breast cancer, typically presents as an irregularly shaped mass with poorly defined margins. A mammary abscess would have a distinct clinical presentation and would not necessarily be well-circumscribed. Fat necrosis is a condition caused by trauma to the breast tissue and would present as an irregularly shaped mass with a firm or hard consistency and may have associated skin changes. Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation of the report is fibroadenoma.",d,d,TRUE,

[distribution of varicella zoster is centripetal (more in central area (trunk) and less in limbs and face. on the other hand if blisters are present mainly on face or limbs and/or described as golden, yellow or honey coloured crusts are impetigo].","Based on the presentation of a young boy with peri-oral blisters, the most appropriate diagnosis is a. impetigo. This is due to the fact that impetigo is characterized by yellow or honey-colored crusts, which are consistent with the boy's symptoms. In contrast, varicella zoster distribution is centripetal, meaning it is more likely to occur in the central area (trunk) and less likely on the limbs and face, making it an incorrect option. Shingles is a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus and would present with a painful rash in a specific dermatome, but this is not mentioned in the boy's symptoms. Scabies presents with itching and burrows, which are not described, and herpes simplex virus is not commonly associated with peri-oral blisters. Thus, impetigo is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,

[cd4 count 35 is too low indicating immunodeficiency where molluscum contagiosum occurs more easily. umbilicated papules are feature of molluscum contagiosum].,"Given the clinical presentation of umbilicated papules on the face and a cd4 count of 35, the most likely diagnosis is f. molluscum contagiosum. This viral infection is more common in immunocompromised individuals, and the characteristic feature of the lesions is the central umbilication. Options a, b, d, and e are unlikely as they typically present with different clinical features such as respiratory symptoms, fever, or neurological deficits. Option c, Streptokinase, is a thrombolytic agent and is not related to the patient's condition. Therefore, option f is the most appropriate option based on the clinical presentation and immunodeficiency status of the patient.",f,f,TRUE,

[pansystolic murmur at apex indicates mitral regurgitation and irregular pulse indicates af which can lead to thrombus formation what probably is responsible for this embolus in leg].,"Based on the given symptoms, the most probable diagnosis is e) embolus. The presence of a pansystolic murmur at the apex indicates mitral regurgitation, while the irregular pulse suggests atrial fibrillation which can lead to thrombus formation. This thrombus can then break off and travel to the leg, leading to the observed symptoms of absent pulses and pale limb. Thromboangitis obliterans would present with pain in the affected limb and claudication, but would not lead to absent pulses. Sciatica is a nerve-related issue and would not affect pulses. DVT would present with swelling and pain in the affected leg, but not necessarily affect pulses. Atherosclerosis would lead to gradual narrowing of the arteries and would not cause sudden onset of symptoms.",e,e,TRUE,

[here sudden onset and rise of temperature are points indicating the diagnosis of mumps].,"Based on the presented symptoms, the most likely diagnosis for the 18-year-old man is b. mumps. The sudden onset and the rise in temperature are two key indicators of mumps. Dental caries, OE (otitis externa), OM (otitis media), and temporomandibular joint pain do not typically present with a smooth and tender swelling extending from the ear to the angle of the jaw and a rise in temperature. Therefore, these other options can be ruled out based on the presented symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,

[this is a benign condition known as “mongolian spot” or “mongolian blue”. mongolian spot refers to a macular blue-gray pigmentation usually on the sacral area of healthy infants. mongolian spot is usually present at birth or appears within the first weeks of life. mongolian spot typically disappears spontaneously within 4 years but can persist for life].,"The correct answer to this question is a. reassure. The blue mark near the coccyx is a benign condition known as “mongolian spot” or “mongolian blue,” which is a macular blue-gray pigmentation usually found on the sacral area of healthy infants. Mongolian spot is usually present at birth or appears within the first weeks of life and typically disappears spontaneously within 4 years but can persist for life. Coagulation profile (b), karyotyping (c), skeletal survey (d), and CT (e) are not necessary in this case as the presence of this blue mark does not indicate any serious medical condition. Therefore, reassuring the mother and informing her about the nature of the condition is the appropriate response in this situation.",a,a,TRUE,
1209. a man presents with inoperable carcinoma and back pain. his pain has been well controlled with morphine but he develops vomiting. morphine was stopped and he was started on metoclopramide and fentanyl patches. he then develops neck stiffness and fever. what is the cause of these symptoms?,a. metoclopramide,b. fentanyl,c. morphine,d. meningitis,e. metastasis,,,,,,key: the key is a. metoclopramide. [extrapyramidal effects like neck stiffness is common side effect of metoclopramide and also there may occur rise of temperature].,"The correct answer is a. metoclopramide. Metoclopramide is known to cause extrapyramidal effects such as neck stiffness, which may explain the patient's symptom. Additionally, metoclopramide may cause a rise in temperature, which could explain the fever. While fentanyl and morphine are both opioids, they do not typically cause the symptoms described by the patient. Meningitis and metastasis are both possible causes of the symptoms, but there is not enough information provided in the question to definitively diagnose either as the cause. Overall, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is the metoclopramide, and it should be discontinued or its dosage adjusted accordingly.",a,a,TRUE,

[only anemia with macrocytosis is with normal examination findings makes megaloblastic aneamia to be most likely cause where pbf shows hypersegmented neutrophils].,"Based on the given information, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by macrocytosis, which is present in this patient (MCV=132fl), along with a low hemoglobin level (9.2g/dL) and hematocrit level (27.9%). The peripheral blood smear (PBF) finding that is most likely to be present is hypersegmented neutrophils. This is because anemia with macrocytosis and normal examination findings is indicative of megaloblastic anemia, which is associated with hypersegmented neutrophils on PBF. Option B, nucleated red blood cells, is a feature of erythropoietic activity and is typically present in the bone marrow, not peripheral blood. Option C, blasts, are seen in acute leukemias, and option D, hypochromic, microcytic red blood cells, is characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. Option E, schistocytes, are seen in conditions like disseminated intravascular coagulation or hemolytic uremic syndrome, which are not indicated by the patient's presentation.",a,a,TRUE,

The diagnostic criteria for abdominal migraine include attacks of abdominal pain lasting 1-72 hours, midline location, periumbilical or poorly localized, and moderate or severe intensity, which the girl seems to match. There are no indications for a more serious condition that would require imaging or further tests, especially since her lab results and physical examination were normal. Therefore, the best course of action would be to provide reassurance to the patient and her parents that this is a common condition in children that can be managed with analgesics if needed.

[patient is obese type2 diabetic with normal renal function for whom biguanide is the treatment of choice].,"The correct answer is a) biguanide. In this scenario, the patient is an obese type 2 diabetic with normal renal function who has been previously treated using dietary control. However, his current fasting blood sugar of 14mmol/l indicates poor glycemic control. Regular checks of renal function are necessary in diabetic patients, and in this case, the creatinine level of 90mmol/l is within the normal range. Urine showing glycosuria indicates that the patient's blood glucose levels are exceeding the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption. Option b) sulfonylurea may cause weight gain and hypoglycemia, which is undesirable in an obese patient. Option c) insulin may be considered, but biguanides are generally the first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes and have shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Option d) sugar-free diet may help with weight loss but is not sufficient to control blood sugar levels in this case. Option e) ACE inhibitors are primarily used to manage hypertension and proteinuria in diabetic patients with elevated blood pressure. Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient would be to begin treatment with a biguanide, as it is the recommended first-line therapy for obese type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function.",a,a,TRUE,

[thiazide causes hypercalcemia, hypokalemia and hyponatremia].","Thiazide diuretics are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The most common side effects of thiazide diuretics are hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and hyponatremia. In this case, the correct answer is b. hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics can lead to decreased sodium levels in the blood, which can result in symptoms such as nausea, headache, confusion, and seizures. The other choices are incorrect as thiazide diuretics typically do not cause hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, or hyperkalemia. Thus, it is important for healthcare providers to monitor sodium levels in patients taking thiazide diuretics to prevent hyponatremia and its associated complications.",b,b,TRUE,

[presence of confusion and nystagmus indicates wernicke’s encephalopathy caused by thiamin (vit. b1) deficiency].,"Based on the given information, the correct answer is a. B1 deficiency. This is because the patient is a heavy drinker and thiamin (vit. B1) deficiency is common in alcoholics due to poor dietary intake, impaired absorption, and increased excretion. The presence of nystagmus and confusion suggests Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a neurological disorder caused by thiamin deficiency. Hyperreflexia and elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of red blood cells also support the diagnosis. Therefore, options b, c, d, and e are wrong choices as they do not match the clinical presentation and laboratory findings of the patient. Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause cognitive impairment, but it usually presents with other neurological symptoms such as paresthesia and ataxia. Folate deficiency and alcohol withdrawal alone are unlikely to cause nystagmus and hyperreflexia. Vitamin B6 deficiency may cause peripheral neuropathy but is not associated with the symptoms mentioned in the case.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the most likely diagnosis in this case is a thyroglossal cyst, which is a common developmental abnormality that arises from remnants of the embryonic thyroglossal duct. A FNAC is a minimally invasive procedure that involves using a fine needle to extract cells from the thyroid gland for analysis under a microscope. It is a safe and effective method of diagnosing thyroid cysts and nodules, without the need for more invasive procedures such as a core biopsy or tissue punch biopsy. MRI neck or radioactive thyroid scans are not typically used to diagnose a thyroglossal cyst.",a,a,TRUE,

[features are suggestive of ptb for which most discriminating inv. is sputum for afb].,"The correct answer is a) afb for sputum. This test is the most discriminating investigation for the indication of pulmonary tuberculosis (ptb), which is highly likely in this patient based on his symptoms and CXR findings. PTB is commonly characterized by productive cough, night sweats, and weight loss, and the CXR shadowing in the left upper zone is suggestive of it. While CXR and CT can provide additional information, these tests are not as specific for PTB as afb for sputum. TFT and US abdomen are irrelevant investigations in this case. Therefore, afb for sputum is the most appropriate test to confirm or rule out the presence of PTB in this patient.",a,a,TRUE,

[a short history (one week) of bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain with cramps, fever and tenderness in lower abdomen is indicative of gastroenteritis].","The most appropriate diagnosis for this patient would be e. gastroenteritis. The combination of symptoms of bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain with cramps, fever, and tenderness in the lower abdomen typically indicate gastroenteritis, which is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Celiac disease (a gluten intolerance), colorectal polyps (abnormal growths in the colon or rectum), ulcerative colitis (an inflammatory bowel disease), and laxative abuse are less likely to present with acute symptoms of bloody diarrhea and fever, and tenderness in the lower abdomen. Therefore, the correct answer is e. gastroenteritis.",e,e,TRUE,

This is supported by a reference from patient.info indicating that in the UK, for acute suppurative otitis media, amoxicillin is the preferred choice. The other choices, ciprofloxacillin, flucloxacillin, ceftazidime, and benzyl penicillin, would not be appropriate for this condition. Ciprofloxacin is not suitable for use in children, and flucloxacillin is used for treating staphylococcal infections, which are not typically associated with otitis media. Ceftazidime and benzyl penicillin are generally reserved for serious infections and are not commonly used for otitis media. Thus, based on the clinical presentation and the recommended guidelines, amoxicillin is the most appropriate 1st line antibiotic for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,

[the fregoli delusion, or the delusion of doubles, is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person].","The correct answer is d. delusion of doubles. This is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person. In this case, the man believes that every elderly man he meets is his father wearing different disguises. This is not a delusion of persecution (a belief that someone is out to harm the individual), erotomania (a belief that someone is in love with the individual), delusion of grandeur (a belief in one's own superiority), or delusion of reference (a belief that events or objects have personal significance for the individual). Therefore, the only suitable answer is delusion of doubles.",d,d,TRUE,

[increased fluid intake is advised].,"The correct answer is D, conservative management, which involves increased fluid intake to help flush out the stone. Option A, ESWL, is a non-invasive procedure that uses shock waves to break down the stone, but it is typically reserved for larger stones. Option B, doing nothing, is not recommended as there is a risk of the stone becoming lodged and causing further complications. Option C, open surgery, is invasive and typically reserved for very large or complicated stones. Therefore, conservative management with increased fluid intake is the most appropriate and least invasive option for this patient with a 3mm stone in the renal pelvis.",d,d,TRUE,

[pain and swelling below mandible is due to stone in submandibular salivary gland duct. pain and swelling increased after large meal as the saliva produced during meal could not come out of the gland due to stone].,"The single most likely diagnosis for the 35-year-old man experiencing acute pain and swelling below the mandible on the left side for 2 hours after eating a large meal is submandibular calculus. This is due to a stone in the submandibular salivary gland duct, which is causing the pain and swelling. The increased saliva production during the meal cannot come out of the gland due to blockage by the stone, resulting in the symptoms. Laryngocele, ranula, neck abscess, and parotid calculus are less likely diagnoses as they involve different structures and symptoms.",e,e,TRUE,

[presentation can be described by either optic neuritis or retrobulbar neuritis. in optic neuritis there is disc pallor. as in this case disc is normal it is a case of retrobulbar neuritis].,"Based on the given presentation, the most appropriate clinical diagnosis for the 45-year-old man is retrobulbar neuritis, which is characterized by impaired vision, pain on eye movement, and loss of color vision. The normal fundus indicates that the issue is not papillitis, while the dilation of the pupil upon light stimulation rules out acute iritis. Acute dacryocystitis and scleritis are also unlikely to present with these symptoms. Therefore, retrobulbar neuritis is the most likely diagnosis and warrants prompt medical attention.",d,d,TRUE,

[quadriplegia is the feature of cervical cord lesion].,"The correct answer to the question is c. cervical spinal cord. This is because the patient is showing signs of quadriplegia, which is a feature of cervical cord lesion. The positive Romberg’s test and weakness and loss of sensations in all four limbs indicate that there is damage to the spinal cord. The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem control different aspects of movement and sensation, but none of them would result in quadriplegia. The thoracic spinal cord mainly controls the lower limbs and trunk, so it is unlikely to be the site of the lesion in this case. Therefore, the cervical spinal cord is the most likely site to be affected, causing the patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
1224. a 58yo man suddenly becomes shocked several days after suffering an acute ant mi. his cxr shows a large globular-shaped heart and clear lung fields. what is the single most likely explanation for the abnormal inv?,a. acute pericarditis,b. cardiac tamponade,c. atrial thrombus,d. left ventricular aneurysm,e. dressler syndrome,,,,,,key: the key is b. cardiac tamponade. [shock in a post mi patient with globular heart on x-ray and clear lung field indicate cardiac tamponade].,"The most likely explanation for the abnormal findings in the CXR of a 58-year-old man who suddenly becomes shocked several days after suffering an acute ant MI is cardiac tamponade, which is indicated by the key ""b."" The presence of a large globular-shaped heart along with clear lung fields suggests that there is pressure on the heart from outside, which is a typical sign of cardiac tamponade. Acute pericarditis, atrial thrombus, left ventricular aneurysm and Dressler syndrome are all less likely causes of these findings. Acute pericarditis is associated with chest pain and a pericardial friction rub that is absent in this case. Atrial thrombus and left ventricular aneurysm are less common causes of sudden shock post-MI. Dressler syndrome is a delayed autoimmune reaction and it usually presents weeks after the MI. Therefore, the best explanation for a large globular heart and clear lung fields in a patient who is shocked post-MI is cardiac tamponade.",b,b,TRUE,

[if the patient stop alcohol without any supportive treatment there will occur withdrawal symptoms. for the presented situation acamprosate can help by stopping alcohol without producing withdrawal symtoms (by restoring brain chemical derangement caused by alcohol which is responsible for withdrawal symptoms)].,"The correct answer would be A, acamprosate, as it can help the patient stop drinking without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. This medication works by restoring the chemical balance in the brain that is disrupted by alcohol use. Referring the patient to a clinical psychologist or GP may be helpful, but it does not directly address the issue of alcohol withdrawal. Desipramine is an antidepressant and has no direct effect on alcohol withdrawal. Referring the patient to a community mental health support group may be helpful in the long term, but it does not address the immediate issue of alcohol withdrawal. Therefore, acamprosate is the best option for this patient's situation.",a,a,TRUE,

[older people are less likely to go under closed reduction even if the dorsal angulation is not anatomic (like 20 degrees!). less than 10 degree dorsal angulation does not require even closed reduction].,"The correct answer to this question is a. below elbow full plaster of paris. Closed reduction of the fracture, which was initially given as the key, is not the most appropriate treatment for an 80-year-old woman with less than 10 degrees of dorsal angulation. Older individuals are less likely to undergo closed reduction, even if the fracture is not anatomically aligned. Additionally, less than 10 degrees of dorsal angulation does not require closed reduction. Elasticated support bandage is not an appropriate treatment for a fracture, and open reduction and internal fixation is not necessary for a fracture with this degree of angulation. Below elbow split plaster of paris is also not the most appropriate treatment as it does not allow for sufficient immobilization of the fracture. Therefore, below elbow full plaster of paris is the most appropriate treatment for an 80-year-old woman with a radius fracture with less than 10 degrees of dorsal angulation as it provides adequate immobilization and support to the fracture site.",c,c,TRUE,

NSAIDs (mefenamic acid). NSAIDs work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and reducing menstrual flow and pain. Antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid work by stabilizing blood clots, but may not be effective in reducing menstrual flow. COCP (combined oral contraceptive pills) and IUS (intrauterine system) progestogens (Mirena) also reduce menstrual flow and pain, but may not be appropriate for a young, nulliparous woman. Endometrial ablation is an invasive procedure and is not recommended as first-line treatment. In conclusion, NSAIDs are the most appropriate and effective management for the given patient's condition.",e,e,TRUE,
1228. a 67yo lady with an ulcer on the anal margin. which is the single most appropriate ln involved?,a. external iliac ln,b. pre-aortic ln,c. aortic ln,d. inguinal ln,e. iliac ln,,,,,,key: the key is d. inguinal ln. [anal canal below pectinate line is drained into superficial inguinal lymph nodes].,"The correct answer for this question is d. inguinal lymph node. This is because lymph from the anal canal below the pectinate line is drained into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. This is in contrast to lymph from the anal canal above the pectinate line which is drained into the internal iliac lymph nodes. Therefore, the single most appropriate lymph node for this patient's ulcer on the anal margin would be the inguinal lymph node. The other choices are not appropriate because they do not receive lymphatic drainage from the anal canal.",d,d,TRUE,
1229. a branch of the dominant coronary artery that supplies the inferior portion of the septum. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. septal branches,b. obtuse marginal branches,c. circumflex artery,"d. left main stem, post descending artery",e. diagonal branch,,,,,,"key: the key is d. left main stem, post descending artery. [here no option is satisfactorily correct! by dominant coronary artery we mean that coronary artery which gives of the branch of posterior descending artery. mostly it is right coronary artery and if there is left coronary dominance, posterior descending artery is the branch of circumflex artery and not direct branch of left main artery. however the only option that goes nearer is d. left main stem, post. descending artery].","The correct option to the question is a. septal branches. By dominant coronary artery, we mean the artery that supplies the posterior descending artery. Usually, the right coronary artery is the dominant coronary artery, and if the left coronary artery is dominant, the posterior descending artery is a branch of the circumflex artery and not a direct branch of the left main artery. Therefore, the only option that comes close is a. septal branches as it supplies the inferior portion of the septum. The other options are wrong as they do not supply the inferior portion of the septum. Overall, the answer a. septal branches is the most appropriate option.",d,a,corrected,
1230. a 55yo female presented with anemia and dysphagia. there is a feeling of something stuck in the throat. the esophagus can’t be negotiated beyond the crico-pharynx. what is the most probable dx?,a. foreign body,b. plummer vinson syndrome,c. pharyngeal carcinoma,d. barret’s esophagus,e. esophageal carcinoma,,,,,,key: the key is b. plummer vinson syndrome. [the picture fits two d/d. 1. plummer vinson syndrome 2. oesophagial carcinoma. lower oesophagial stricture is more common for ca. so presenting case is likely a case of plummer vinson syndrome. it can be differentiated by the type of anemia. if it is ida dx is plummer vinson syndrome].,"The correct answer is b. Plummer Vinson syndrome. This is because the patient presented with both anemia and dysphagia, which are classic symptoms of this syndrome. Additionally, the feeling of something stuck in the throat and the inability to pass a scope beyond the crico-pharynx are also consistent with Plummer Vinson syndrome. It can be differentiated from esophageal carcinoma by the type of anemia - if the anemia is iron deficiency anemia, then it is likely to be Plummer Vinson syndrome. Foreign body is an unlikely diagnosis because the sensation would likely be due to an internal obstruction rather than an external object. Pharyngeal carcinoma and Barret's esophagus are less likely because they do not usually present with both anemia and dysphagia together.",b,b,TRUE,
1231. a pt is on cancer tx with dexamethasone. according to her biochemical results her k+=normal and her na+=low. what is the dx?,a. addisons,b. dexamethasone side effect,c. dilutional hyponatremia,,,,,,,,key: the key is c. dilutional hyponatremia.,"The correct answer is c. dilutional hyponatremia. This occurs as a result of excessive water intake leading to a relative decrease in sodium concentration in the blood. In this case, the patient's normal potassium levels indicate normal adrenal function, ruling out Addison's disease as a potential diagnosis. While dexamethasone can cause fluid retention, it typically results in high sodium levels rather than low, making b. dexamethasone side effect an incorrect choice. Dilutional hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disturbance in cancer patients, particularly those receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, the low sodium levels in this patient are likely a result of dilutional hyponatremia.",c,c,TRUE,
"1232. a diabetic has been prescribed a long acting hypoglycemic in the morning and short acting in the evening. he takes a regular lunch, but has been having hypoglycemic attacks at around 4pm each day. what is the most appropriate intervention?",a. recommend a heavier lunch,b. review morning drug,c. review evening drug,d. review both drug,e. reassure,,,,,,key: the key is b. review morning drug. [as there is hypoglycemic attacks at evening morning dose needs to be adjusted].,"The most appropriate intervention for a diabetic patient who has been prescribed a long acting hypoglycemic in the morning and short acting in the evening and experiences hypoglycemic attacks at 4pm each day would be to review the morning drug (option b). This is because adjusting the morning dose can help prevent hypoglycemic attacks in the afternoon. Recommending a heavier lunch (option a) may not completely address the issue of hypoglycemia and increasing food intake too much can also lead to hyperglycemia. Reviewing the evening drug (option c) or both drugs (option d) may not be necessary since the attacks are occurring in the afternoon, after taking the morning medication. Reassuring the patient (option e) without addressing the issue at hand does not solve the problem and should not be considered as a treatment option. Therefore, reviewing the morning drug is the most effective intervention to address the patient's hypoglycemic attacks.",b,b,TRUE,
1233. a male pt presented with blood and mucus in stool. he has also noticed weight loss but has no hx of altered bowel habits. what is the dx?,a. carcinoma of cecum,b. carcinoma of descending colon,c. carcinoma of sigmoid colon,d. carcinoma of rectum,,,,,,,key: the key is a. carcinoma of cecum.,"Based on the symptoms presented, the correct diagnosis is likely a. carcinoma of cecum. The presence of blood and mucus in stool, along with weight loss, can indicate a malignancy in the gastrointestinal tract. The absence of altered bowel habits suggests that the tumor is in the early stages, which often occurs in cecal carcinomas. The other options, ranging from descending and sigmoid colon to rectum, are also possibilities, but they do not match the patient's symptoms as closely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is carcinoma of cecum. It is important for the patient to undergo further testing and treatment to ensure the best possible outcome.",a,a,TRUE,
1234. a 22yo man keeps having persistent and intrusive thoughts that he is a dirty thief. no matter what he tries these thoughts keep coming to him. any attempt to avoid these thoughts leads to serious anxiety. what is the most likely dx?,a. schizophrenia,b. ocd,c. ptsd,d. mania,e. psychotic depression,,,,,,key: the key is b. ocd. [though here is obsession or thoughts but no compulsion of activity but there is  compulsion of thoughts as well which makes the diagnosis as ocd].,"The correct answer to the question is b. OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). This is because the man is experiencing persistent and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) about being a dirty thief, and attempts to avoid these thoughts lead to serious anxiety. This is a classic symptom of OCD, which is characterized by both obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors or mental acts. Schizophrenia (answer a) is a serious mental disorder that is characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and behaviors. PTSD (answer c) is a mental health condition that can occur after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. Mania (answer d) is a symptom of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by periods of high energy, euphoria, and sometimes reckless behavior. Psychotic depression (answer e) is a subtype of major depressive disorder that includes symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. None of these diagnoses are a good fit for the man's symptoms, which are most consistent with OCD.",b,b,TRUE,
1235. a 45yo female comes to the ed while having a generalized tonic clonic seizure and she has having difficulty breathing and is cyanosed. what is the tx option for her?,a. secure airways,b. iv diazepam,c. iv phenytoin,d. oxygen mask,,,,,,,"key: a. secure airways. [breathing difficulty with cyanosis may indicate saliva, blood, foreign body (as denture), fall back of tongue etc. for which 1st action is to secure airway].","In this scenario, the correct answer is a) Secure airways. The patient is presenting with breathing difficulty and cyanosis, which may indicate an obstruction such as saliva, blood, or a foreign body. The priority in this situation is to ensure that the patient's airway is clear so that they can breathe properly. Administering IV diazepam or phenytoin or an oxygen mask may be necessary later depending on the nature of the seizure, but first and foremost, the patient's immediate issue of breathing difficulty must be addressed. Therefore, options b, c, and d are incorrect as they do not address the patient's immediate need of a secure airway.",a,a,TRUE,
1236. a 30yo man is becoming concerned about the safety of his family. he has been checking the locks of the door every hour during the night. he becomes very anxious if his wife tries to stop him. what is the most likely dx?,a. paranoid delusion,b. ptsd,c. social phobia,d. ocd,e. gad,,,,,,"key: the key is d. ocd. [obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive activity. an obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters a person's mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease. a compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought].","The correct answer is d. OCD. OCD is a mental health condition characterized by obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. In this case, the man has a specific obsession about the safety of his family and a compulsion to check the locks on the doors every hour during the night. The fact that he becomes very anxious if his wife tries to stop him indicates that he has difficulty controlling these behaviors and may feel an overwhelming need to carry them out. Paranoid delusion, PTSD, social phobia, and GAD are unlikely diagnoses as they do not specifically involve obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors related to checking the locks on doors.",d,d,TRUE,
1237. a 6wk baby has been dx as hiv+ve. which immunization plan will you opt for him?,a. don’t give any vaccine,b. give all vaccines except live attenuated vaccines,c. give only bcg vaccine,d. give all vaccines except bcg vaccine,,,,,,,key: the key is d. give all vaccines except bcg vaccine. [there are two terms hiv +ve (not immune deficient yet) and aids (immune deficient state). in hiv +ve case live attenuated vaccines can be given except bcg and if aids all live attenuated vaccines are avoided].,"For a 6-week-old baby diagnosed with HIV+, option d is the correct immunization plan. This entails giving all vaccines except for the BCG vaccine. It is important to note that if the baby were in the advanced state of AIDS, all live attenuated vaccines would be avoided. This is because the baby's immune system would be greatly compromised, making it difficult for them to fight off infections from these vaccines. Option a (not giving any vaccine) and option c (giving only BCG vaccine) are both incorrect because not giving any vaccine will leave the baby susceptible to infectious diseases, and giving only the BCG vaccine would leave them unprotected against other deadly diseases. Option b (giving all vaccines except live attenuated vaccines) is incorrect because HIV+ babies can receive live attenuated vaccines except for BCG.",d,d,TRUE,
1238. a 36yo man has been dx with di. what electrolyte picture is expected to be seen?,"a. high serum na, low serum osmolarity, high urine osmolarity","b. low serum na, low serum osmolarity, high urine osmolarity","c. low serum na, high serum osmolarity, high urine osmolarity","d. high serum na, high serum osmolarity, low urine osmolarity","e. normal na, normal serum osmolarity, normal urine osmolarity",,,,,,"key: the key is d. high serum na, high serum osmolarity, low urine osmolarity.","When a 36-year-old man is diagnosed with diabetes insipidus (DI), the electrolyte picture that is expected to be seen is high serum sodium, high serum osmolarity, and low urine osmolarity, which is choice d. DI is a rare disorder that affects the body's ability to regulate water balance, resulting in excessive thirst and diluted urine. The high serum sodium is a result of the body's inability to retain water, which causes dehydration and higher levels of sodium in the blood. The high serum osmolarity is due to the lack of water in the body, which increases the concentration of particles in the blood. The low urine osmolarity is a result of the body's inability to concentrate urine, due to reduced levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or its action in the kidneys. Choices a, b, c, and e are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the electrolyte imbalance that occurs in DI.",d,d,TRUE,
1239. the artery that supplies the ant right ventricular wall. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. acute marginal branch,b. left ant descending artery,c. coronary sinus,d. circumflex artery,e. right coronary artery,,,,,,key: the key is a. acute marginal branch.,"The correct answer to this question is a. acute marginal branch because it is the artery that supplies the ant right ventricular wall. The acute marginal branch is a branch of the right coronary artery which supplies the ant and lateral surfaces of the right ventricle. The other choices are incorrect because they do not supply the right ventricular wall. The left ant descending artery supplies the left ventricle, the coronary sinus drains the cardiac veins, the circumflex artery supplies the left atrium and left ventricle, and the right coronary artery supplies the right atrium and ventricle, but not directly the ant right ventricular wall.",a,a,TRUE,
"1240. a 55yo male presents to the ed after an rta with breathlessness, engorged neck veins and a dull percussion note on the right side of his chest. exam: pulse=140bpm, bp=80/50mmhg. what is the most likely dx?",a. hemothorax,b. hemopneumothorax,c. tension pneumothorax,d. simple pneumothorax,,,,,,,key: the key is b. hemopneumothorax.,"Based on the presented symptoms, the most likely diagnosis would be hemopneumothorax, indicated by the presence of both blood and air in the pleural cavity. The dull percussion note on the right side of the chest indicates the presence of fluid (blood) in the pleural space, which likely originated from the rta. The engorged neck veins suggest increased venous pressure due to impaired expiration caused by the accumulation of air and/or blood in the pleural cavity. The elevated pulse rate and decreased blood pressure indicate that the patient is experiencing hemodynamic instability, which is likely related to the severity of the hemopneumothorax. Therefore, options a, c, and d can be excluded because they do not account for the presence of both blood and air in the pleural cavity. Option b is the only accurate diagnosis, as it accounts for both blood and air accumulation in the pleural cavity and can explain the presented symptoms and clinical features.",b,b,TRUE,
1241. a 32yo woman presents with complaints of having low back pain. she is taking analgesics for it. all inv are normal. what will you advice her?,a. bed rest,b. physiotherapy,c. advice to be more active,d. admit,,,,,,,key: c. advice to be more active.,"The correct answer is c. advice to be more active. Bed rest is no longer recommended for low back pain as it can actually worsen the condition. Physiotherapy may be helpful but the first line of treatment is to encourage the patient to stay active and continue with their daily activities as much as possible. This can help alleviate the pain and prevent further complications. Admitting the patient is not necessary as all tests are normal and the condition can be managed in an outpatient setting. Therefore, advice to be more active is the most appropriate and evidence-based recommendation for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,
1242. a 32yo woman suffers an episode of severe occipital headache with vomiting and loc. she is brought to the hosp where she is found to be conscious and completely alert. exam: normal pulse and bp with no abnormal neurological sign. what is the next step in her management?,a. admission for observation,b. ct brain,c. mri head,d. reassurance and discharge home,e. xr skull,,,,,,key: the key is b. ct brain. [to exclude any possible intracranial bleeding].,"The correct answer is b. CT brain. This is because the patient's symptoms indicate the possibility of intracranial bleeding, and a CT scan can quickly and accurately diagnose or exclude this condition. Admission for observation (choice a) may be necessary if the CT scan is inconclusive, but it is not the first step. MRI head (choice c) is a more detailed imaging study, but it takes longer and is not necessary in this emergency situation. Reassurance and discharge (choice d) is not an appropriate option given the severity of the patient's symptoms. X-ray of the skull (choice e) is not useful in evaluating neurological conditions and will not provide the necessary information to manage the patient.",b,b,TRUE,
1243. a 30yo woman is taking tx for asthma. she has a hr=130bpm and peak expiratory flow rate=400. what is the most appropriate management?,a. atenolol,b. digoxin,c. review drugs,,,,,,,,key: the key is c. review drugs. [oral beta agonist frequently causes tachycardia and palpitations].,"The correct answer for this question is C: ""review drugs"". This woman is currently experiencing tachycardia, which is a common side effect of oral beta agonists, which are typically used for asthma treatment. Atenolol (option A) is a beta blocker, which would further decrease her heart rate and potentially worsen her asthma symptoms. Digoxin (option B) is a medication used for heart failure and atrial fibrillation; it has no role in the treatment of asthma and could also potentially worsen her asthma symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient would be to review her current medications and potentially change her asthma treatment to avoid the associated side effects.",c,c,TRUE,
1244. a pt presents with a mask face. he also has gait prbs. which class of drug is causing this?,a. anti-depressant,b. anti-psychotic,c. anti-htn,,,,,,,,key: the key is b. anty-psychotic. [anti-psychotics by reducing dopamine can precipitate or induce parkinsonism].,"The key to this question is option b, anti-psychotic. This class of drugs works by reducing dopamine levels in the brain, which can lead to the development of parkinsonism - a group of symptoms that include mask face (reduced facial expression) and gait problems. Therefore, it is likely that the anti-psychotic medication is causing these symptoms in the patient. Option a, anti-depressants, and option c, anti-hypertensives, are not typically associated with parkinsonism. Thus, the correct answer is b.",b,b,TRUE,
1245. a 16yo boy came home from boarding school with a cough. his cxr showed bilateral consolidations. what is the most likely organism which would have caused his symptoms?,a. legionella pneumophilia,b. mycoplasma pneumonia,c. mycobacterium tb,d. pneumocystis jiroveci,e. pseudomonas aeruginosa,,,,,,"key: the key is b. mycoplasma pneumonia. [mycoplasma is common in military barrack, prison or boarding dwellers].","The correct answer is b. mycoplasma pneumonia. Mycoplasma is a common organism that causes respiratory infections, particularly in crowded populations such as military barracks, prisons, and boarding schools. Legionella pneumophilia is a type of pneumonia generally acquired from environmental exposure. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis and typically presents with granulomas on CXR. Pneumocystis jiroveci is associated with immunocompromised individuals, such as those with AIDS. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, based on the patient's age, the clinical presentation and CXR results, mycoplasma pneumonia is the most likely organism responsible for this patient's illness.",b,b,TRUE,
"1246. after an mi, a man presents with pansystolic murmur which is radiating to the axilla. what is the dx?",a. tricuspid regurgitation,b. mitral regurgitation,c. aortic stenosis,d. mitral stenosis,,,,,,,key: the key is b. mitral regurgitation. [mi can lead to papillary muscle rupture causing mitral regurgitation].,"The correct answer to this question is b. mitral regurgitation. After an MI, the papillary muscles can be damaged or rupture, which can cause mitral regurgitation. This leads to a pansystolic murmur that can be heard best at the apex of the heart and radiates to the axilla. Tricuspid regurgitation is associated with a holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border and is not typically associated with an MI. Aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis are both associated with systolic murmurs, but they are not pansystolic, and they are not commonly caused by an MI. Therefore, b. mitral regurgitation is the correct choice for this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,
"1247. a 34yo labourer developed severe pain in his lower back after lifting a sack of sand. he also complains of shooting pain down his leg. the gp has prescribed him complete bed rest, with painkillers and also scheduled an mri for him. what is the most likely dx?",a. peripheral vascular disease,b. intervertebral disc prolapse,c. hairline fx of the spine,d. sprain of the back muscles,e. muscle injury,,,,,,key: the key is b. intervertebral disc prolapse. [intervertebral disc prolapsed can cause severe back pain following heavy lifting and radiculopathy (pressure on spinal nerve root) can cause this shooting pain which can be demonstrated by mri spine].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 34-year-old labourer who developed severe lower back pain after lifting a sack of sand and complained of shooting pain down his leg is intervertebral disc prolapse, which is indicated by the key ""b"" in the question. This condition can occur due to heavy lifting and can lead to radiculopathy, which is pressure on the spinal nerve root causing shooting pain that can be confirmed through MRI spine. Peripheral vascular disease (a) is unlikely in this case as it involves arterial or venous insufficiency in the limbs, and hairline fracture of the spine (c) would likely be accompanied by more severe symptoms and trauma. Sprain of the back muscles (d) and muscle injury (e) would also not account for the shooting pain down the leg and complete bed rest would not be necessary.",b,b,TRUE,
1248. a young man returns to his hostel and gets headache and lethargy. now presents with fever. there are crepitations on the auscultation of lung. what is the most likely organism which would have caused his symptoms?,a. legionella pneumonia,b. mycoplasma,c. staphylococcus,d. streptococcus,,,,,,,"key: the key is a. legionella pneumonia. [legionella is common in hostel, hotel, hospital, nursing home where it spread through their water system, aircondition etc.].","Based on the presented symptoms, the most likely organism causing the illness is legionella pneumonia, which is commonly found in settings such as hostels, hotels, hospitals, and nursing homes, spreading via water systems, ventilation, and air conditioning. Mycoplasma, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus do not typically present with crepitations on lung auscultation, which is a key symptom of legionella pneumonia in this case. Therefore, option A is the correct answer while the other options are wrong.",a,a,TRUE,
1249. a pt is about to undergo surgery. her hgb=8.9g/dl and mcv=70. what is the best option for her?,a. inv and postpone the surgery,b. transfuse and proceed with surgery,c. transfuse and defer surgery,d. continue with surgery,,,,,,,key: key is a. investigation and postpone the surgery. [for elective operation only proceed if hb% > 10 g/dl. if hb% < 10 g/dl then defer the operation and  investigate first. if hb% < 8 g/dl also must be transfused. samson note].,"The best option for a patient with a hgb of 8.9g/dl and mcv of 70 who is about to undergo surgery is to postpone the surgery and investigate further. According to the key, elective operation should only proceed if the hb% is above 10 g/dl. If the hb% is below 10 g/dl, the operation should be deferred and investigations should be conducted before considering surgery. Furthermore, if the hb% is below 8 g/dl, the patient must be transfused. Therefore, options b, c, and d are incorrect as they involve transfusing or proceeding with surgery, which is not recommended for a patient with a low hb% and requires further investigation.",a,a,TRUE,
1250. a 24yo male presents with discomfort in the groin area and scrotal swelling. exam: scrotal skin is normal. what would be the next best step?,a. urgent us,b. urgent surgery,c. opd referral,d. antibiotics,,,,,,,key: the key is c. opd referral. [a case of inguinal hernia or hydrocele. in both torsion or epididymo-orchitis scrotal skin will be inflammed (erythematous and oedematous). should be referred to surgery opd].,"The correct answer is C, OPD referral. This is because the patient's symptoms of discomfort in the groin area and scrotal swelling do not indicate an urgent issue that requires immediate surgery (option B). Similarly, an urgent ultrasound (option A) is not necessary as the scrotal skin is normal and does not suggest any serious underlying condition. Antibiotics (option D) may be useful in cases of infection, such as epididymo-orchitis which can cause inflamed scrotal skin, but this is not the only possible diagnosis. Therefore, the best option is to refer the patient to the surgery OPD for further evaluation and diagnosis of the underlying cause, which may or may not require surgery.",c,c,TRUE,
1251. a 22yo girl unhappy about her weight with bmi=22. she likes to have her dinner in an expensive restaurant. she does excessive shopping. k+=3.3. what is the dx?,a. anorexia nervosa,b. bipolar,c. ocd,d. bulimia,,,,,,,"key: the key is d. bulimia. [bmi 22, even though unhappy, hypokalemia, like to have dinner in an expensive restaurant (probable binge eating) suggest the diagnosis of bulimia].","The correct answer is d, bulimia. This is suggested by the fact that the patient is unhappy about her weight despite having a BMI within the normal range, which may indicate body dysmorphia, a common feature of bulimia. Additionally, her liking to have dinner in an expensive restaurant could be indicative of binge-eating behavior, which is a hallmark symptom of bulimia. The fact that her potassium levels are low (K+=3.3) also suggests that she may be purging, which is another characteristic behavior of individuals with bulimia. Anorexia nervosa is unlikely as the patient's BMI is not low enough, and bipolar disorder and OCD do not fit the symptoms presented.",d,d,TRUE,
"1252. a 59yo pt has been dx with htn. his bp has been >160/90mmhg on 3 separate occasions. his biochemical profile is as follows: na+=145mmol/l, k+=6.2mmol/l, creatinine=112umol/l, urea=5.7mmol/l. what is the most appropriate anti-htn drug for him?",a. amlodipine,b. bendroflumethiazide,c. ramipril,d. lorsartan,e. propranolol,,,,,,key: the key is b. bendroflumethiazide. [thiazide reduces na+ and k+ level. so in this picture of upper normal na+ with hyperkalemia thiazide seems to be appropriate].,"Based on the patient's biochemical profile indicating he has hyperkalemia and upper normal sodium levels, the most appropriate anti-hypertensive drug for him would be choice B, Bendroflumethiazide. Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic which helps to reduce sodium and potassium levels, making it an appropriate choice for this patient. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, which may be less effective in patients with kidney impairment like this patient. Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor, which can cause increased potassium levels and worsen hyperkalemia. Lorsartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker, which has a similar risk for causing hyperkalemia. Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which has no effect on sodium nor potassium levels and may be less effective in older patients. Overall, Bendroflumethiazide is the most appropriate choice for this patient given his laboratory results.",b,b,TRUE,
1253. a 22yo girl had a fight with her boyfriend and then took 22 tabs of paracetamol. she was commenced on n-acetyl cysteine and she was medically fit to go home the following day. which of the following does she require?,a. opd referral to relationship counselor,b. opd referral to psychiatrist,c. inpatient referral to psychiatrist,d. inpatient referral to psychologist,,,,,,,key: the key is c. inpatient referral to psychiatrist. [suicidal ideation is abnormal and if discharged there is chance of repeated suicidal attempts. so inpatient referral to psychiatrist is needed for this patient].,"In this scenario, the most appropriate answer is c, inpatient referral to psychiatrist. The patient's action of taking a large amount of paracetamol following a fight with her boyfriend indicates suicidal ideation, which is abnormal and requires immediate attention. Discharging the patient without further monitoring and treatment would increase the risk of repeated suicidal attempts. Therefore, inpatient referral to a psychiatrist is necessary to provide the patient with appropriate mental health care. Options a and b, which suggest OPD referral to a relationship counselor or psychiatrist, respectively, may not be enough to address the underlying mental health concerns. Option d, inpatient referral to psychologist, is not the most appropriate option as the patient requires a mental health professional who can prescribe medication if necessary, which only a psychiatrist can do.",c,c,TRUE,
1254. a 74yo man presents with sudden onset of with right sided weakness and slurred speech. he also has loss of sensation over the right side of the body and visual field defects. ct shows ischemic stroke. what is the most appropriate management?,a. alteplase,b. streptokinase,c. nimodipine,d. aspirin,e. labetolol,,,,,,key: the key is a. alteplase. [patient has acute onset of symptoms and time of onset is also known. so considering window period of 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms can be given alteplase].,"In this scenario, the most appropriate management would be to administer alteplase, which is a thrombolytic agent. This is because the patient has presented with acute onset of symptoms and the time of onset is also known. Considering the window period of 4.5 hours from onset of symptoms, alteplase can be given to dissolve the clot causing the ischemic stroke. Choosing options such as streptokinase or nimodipine would not be appropriate as they are not indicated for ischemic stroke. Aspirin may be given to the patient, but it is not the primary intervention in this case. Labetolol is not indicated in the management of stroke as it is a beta blocker used to treat hypertension. Thus, alteplase is the most appropriate choice for the management of this patient with an acute ischemic stroke.",a,a,TRUE,
1255. the artery that runs along the left av groove. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. left internal mammary artery,b. left anterior descending artery,c. circumflex artery,d. left main stem (lms) post descending artery,e. diagonal branch,,,,,,key: the key is c. circumflex artery.,"The correct answer to the question is c. circumflex artery. The circumflex artery is known for running along the left AV groove, making it the most appropriate option for this question. The other options listed are not located in the same area as the left AV groove, making them incorrect choices. The left internal mammary artery runs along the front of the heart, the left anterior descending artery runs along the front of the left ventricle, the left main stem post descending artery runs along the back of the heart, and the diagonal branch branches off of the left anterior descending artery and runs diagonally down towards the apex of the heart. Therefore, the circumflex artery is the only correct option based on its location.",c,c,TRUE,
1256. a 26yo man presents with painless hematuria. he has no other complaints and on examination no other abnormality is found. what is the most appropriate initial inv to get to a dx?,a. cystoscopy,b. midstream urine for culture,c. abdominal us,d. mri spine,e. coag screening,,,,,,"key: the key is c. abdominal ultrasound. [abdominal us to exclude polycystic disease, malignancy, tumour, urolithiasis etc].","The most appropriate initial investigation in a 26-year-old man presenting with painless hematuria is an abdominal ultrasound (US). An abdominal US is used to exclude conditions such as polycystic disease, malignancy, tumor, and urolithiasis, which are all potential causes of hematuria. Cystoscopy and midstream urine culture are not the most appropriate initial investigations in this case, as they only focus on the lower urinary tract and cannot rule out other potential causes of hematuria. MRI spine and coagulation screening are also not indicated in this scenario, as they are not relevant to the diagnosis of hematuria. Therefore, an abdominal US is the most appropriate initial investigation to help diagnose the underlying cause of painless hematuria in this patient.",c,c,TRUE,
"1257. a pt, 50yo smoker and heavy drinker, presents with complaints of racing heart. a 24h ekg comes out normal. what is your next step in management?",a. echo,b. reassure,c. stress test,,,,,,,,key: the key is b. reassure. [racing heart or palpitation is a common phenomenon in alcoholics which is not serious or harmful. so reassure the patient].,"The correct answer is b. reassure. Racing heart or palpitation is a common phenomenon in alcoholics and heavy drinkers which is not usually a reason for concern. In this case, a 24 hour EKG has come out as normal, which suggests that the patient's heart is functioning well. Therefore, the next step in management should be to reassure the patient. An echo or stress test would not be necessary at this point as they are unlikely to provide any valuable information that the EKG has not already provided. However, the patient should be advised to quit smoking and heavy drinking as these habits can have adverse effects on their heart health in the long term.",b,b,TRUE,
1258. a 36yo woman came with uterine bleeding. vaginal us reveals uterine thickness=12mm. what is the most probable dx?,a. cervical ca,b. endometrial ca,c. ovarian ca,d. breast ca,e. vaginal ca,,,,,,key: the key is b. endometrial ca. [actually it is endometrial thickening and in general 12 mm means hyperplasia which may suggest endometrial ca in this woman].,"The most probable diagnosis for a 36-year-old woman with uterine bleeding and a uterine thickness of 12mm on vaginal ultrasound is endometrial thickening, which in general may suggest hyperplasia and could potentially lead to endometrial cancer. This is represented by answer choice b. Cervical, ovarian, breast, and vaginal cancers are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings. It is important to note that further diagnostic testing may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of endometrial cancer, such as endometrial biopsy or dilation and curettage.",b,b,TRUE,
1259. a 30yo woman has pid which was treated with metronidazole and cephalosporin. it is getting worse. what is the next best inv?,a. endocervical swab,b. us,c. laparotomy,d. high vaginal swab,,,,,,,key: the key is b. us. [probable tubo-ovarian abscess].,"The next best investigation for a 30-year-old woman with worsening PID despite treatment with metronidazole and cephalosporin is a pelvic ultrasound (answer choice b: US). This investigation can help detect complications such as a probable tubo-ovarian abscess. Endocervical swab (answer choice a) and high vaginal swab (answer choice d) are not necessary at this stage and do not provide information about the presence of an abscess. Laparotomy (answer choice c) is an invasive procedure and is not appropriate as the first-line investigation for suspected PID. Therefore, a pelvic ultrasound is the most appropriate and least invasive investigation in this situation.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because fatty necrosis of the breast occurs when the fatty tissue in the breast is damaged due to trauma or injury such as from a hit to the chest. This can lead to the formation of a mass, which may cause dimpling. Breast cancer (a), carcinoma (b), fibroadenoma (c), and fibroadenosis (d) are all less probable diagnoses in this case, as they typically do not occur as a result of trauma or injury to the breast. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is fatty necrosis of the breast.",e,e,TRUE,
1261. a pregnant pt with rh –ve who hasn’t been prv sensitized delivers her first baby without any prbs. what would be the latest time to administer anti-sensitization?,a. 6h pp,b. 24h pp,c. 48h pp,d. 72h pp,e. 5d pp,,,,,,key: the key is d. 72h pp.,"The correct answer is d, 72h pp. Rh sensitization can occur during pregnancy or childbirth if the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive. If left untreated, this can lead to complications in future pregnancies. Administration of anti-Rh (Rhogam) to the mother after delivery of an Rh-positive baby can prevent sensitization from occurring. The recommended time for administering the anti-Rh is within 72 hours after delivery, hence option d is correct. Options a, b, and c are too early, while option e is too late and may not prevent sensitization. It is important to administer anti-Rh at the correct time to prevent future complications.",d,d,TRUE,
"1262. a 30yo primigravida who is 30wks ga presents to the l&d with absent fetal movements. she also complains of severe headache, heartburn and seeing floaters before her eyes for the last few days. exam: bp=170/110mmhg, urine protein=++++, rock hard uterus, no visible signs of fetal movements. choose the single most likely dx?",a. abruption of placenta 2nd pre-eclampsia,b. antepartum hemorrhage,c. placenta previa,d. primary pph,e. iufd,f. abruption of placenta due to trauma,,,,,key: 2 keys a. abruption of placenta 2nd pre-eclampsia. e. iufd. both are correct!,"The correct answer is a. abruption of placenta 2nd pre-eclampsia. Based on the presentation of severe headache, heartburn, and seeing floaters before her eyes for the last few days, along with the findings of high blood pressure, significant protein in the urine, and a rock-hard uterus with absence of fetal movements, the most likely diagnosis is abruption of the placenta with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is characterized by hypertension with significant proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. The abruption of the placenta represents a separation of the placenta from the uterine lining, which can cause fetal distress and even fetal demise. 

The other answer choices are not as likely given the presentation of this patient. Antepartum hemorrhage and placenta previa would present with vaginal bleeding, which is not mentioned in this scenario. Primary postpartum hemorrhage would not occur until after the delivery, and there is no mention of delivery in this patient. IUFd (intrauterine fetal demise) is a possibility given the absence of fetal movements, but it does not explain the other symptoms and findings seen. Finally, abruption of placenta due to trauma is not mentioned in the scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

[secondary pph occurs from 24 hours after delivery. usually occurs between 5 and 12 days].,"The correct answer is D, secondary PPH. Secondary PPH is defined as excessive bleeding from the vagina occurring between 24 hours and six weeks after delivery. This patient's symptoms match the definition of secondary PPH as she is presenting with heavy vaginal bleeding 10 days postpartum. The other choices are incorrect as abruption of placenta and concealed hemorrhage usually present with sudden onset abdominal pain and fetal distress, primary PPH is defined as excessive bleeding within the first 24 hours after delivery, and retained placenta typically presents with delayed or incomplete placental delivery. Scabies is not related to this patient's presentation.",d,d,TRUE,

[if you have antibodies in your blood, this means you have had chickenpox in the past, or have been immunised. no further action is then needed].","The correct answer is E, reassure. This is because the patient has tested positive for varicella antibody, indicating that she has already had chickenpox in the past or has been immunized against it. Therefore, no further action is needed. Option A, giving varicella Ig, is indicated for pregnant women who have been exposed to chickenpox and have no immunity, but this is not necessary in this case as the patient has tested positive for varicella antibody. Option B, quarantine, is not necessary as the patient is already in her last trimester and has likely already been exposed to the virus. Option C, giving varicella vaccination, is not appropriate as the patient is already in her last trimester and the vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Option D, oral acyclovir, may be given to a pregnant woman who develops chickenpox, but it is not indicated in this case as the patient has not developed any symptoms and has tested positive for varicella antibody.",e,e,TRUE,

This is when there is vaginal bleeding and/or uterine contractions in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, but the cervix is still closed and the fetus is still viable. The other options are incorrect because missed abortion is when the fetus dies but the body does not expel it, aph is an abbreviation for antepartum hemorrhage which occurs after 20 weeks of gestation, miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks, and inevitable abortion means the cervix is open and the fetus cannot be saved. In this scenario, there is no indication that the cervix is open or that the fetus has died, therefore it is most likely a threatened abortion.",a,a,TRUE,

[this is a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas. gas and air won't remove all the pain, but it can help to reduce it and make it more bearable].","The best method of pain relief for the 32-year-old woman in her 28th week of pregnancy who wishes to feel her baby being born but also wants something to work throughout her labour is option C, entonox. Entonox is a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas that can reduce labour pain and make it more bearable. Option A, c-section, is not a pain relief method but rather a surgical procedure that involves delivering the baby through an incision in the abdomen. Option B, pudendal block, involves injecting a local anesthetic into the pudendal nerve to provide pain relief during the second stage of labour, but this may limit the woman's ability to feel her baby being born. Option D, tens, involves using a small electric current applied to the skin through electrodes to reduce pain, but its effectiveness varies and it may not work well for everyone. Option E, pethidine, is a painkiller that can be injected during labour, but it can make the woman feel drowsy and may affect the baby's breathing. Therefore, entonox is the best option for this woman as it can reduce pain while still allowing her to feel the birth of her baby.",c,c,TRUE,
1267. a primipara at fullterm in labor has passed show and the cervix is 3cm dilated. what is the single most appropriate management for her labor?,a. repeat vaginal examination in 4h,b. ctg,c. iv syntocinon drip,d. repeat vaginal examination in 2h,e. induction of labour,,,,,,key: the key is a. repeat vaginal examination in 4h.,"The correct answer to the question is a. Repeat vaginal examination in 4h. This is because the woman is at full term and in labor, and the cervix is dilated to 3cm, indicating progress of labor. However, it is important to note that frequent vaginal examinations can increase the risk of infection and should be avoided unless necessary. Therefore, repeating the examination in 4 hours allows time for labor to progress without unnecessary intervention. Choice b, CTG, is not the most appropriate management as it is a diagnostic tool used to monitor fetal wellbeing and is not necessary at this point in labor. Choice c, iv syntocinon drip, is also not the most appropriate management as it is a form of labor augmentation used when labor is not progressing; in this case, labor is progressing and does not require augmentation. Choice d, repeat vaginal examination in 2h, is not the most appropriate management as it is too soon for a repeat examination and does not allow for sufficient time for labor to progress. Choice e, induction of labor, is not the most appropriate management as the woman is already in labor, and induction is only necessary when labor has not begun spontaneously. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this primipara at full term in labor with a dilated cervix of 3cm is to repeat vaginal examination in 4h.",a,a,TRUE,

[cauvade syndrome, also called sympathetic pregnancy, is a proposed condition in which a partner experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior of an expectant mother].","The correct answer is b. couvade syndrome. This condition is proposed to be experienced by the partner of a pregnant woman, where they exhibit some of the same symptoms and behaviors of the expectant mother, such as morning sickness, easy fatiguability, and even intermittent abdominal pain. Option a, ganser syndrome, is a rare dissociative disorder that involves the presentation of nonsensical or wrong answers to questions posed to the affected individual, while option c, pseudo-psychosis, refers to certain conditions where individuals display symptoms similar to psychosis without meeting the full criteria for a psychotic disorder. Option d, stockholm syndrome, is a psychological phenomenon where hostages express empathy and affection towards their captors, and e, paris syndrome, is a culture-specific syndrome where individuals experience a psychological breakdown when their expectations of Paris, usually based on media portrayals, are not met. Therefore, the husband in this case is most likely experiencing couvade syndrome because his symptoms align with this proposed condition.",b,b,TRUE,

[if hcg >6000iu/l and an intrauterine gestational sac is not seen on trans-abdominal us, ectopic pregnancy is very likely, as is the case if hcg 1000–1500iu/l and no sac is seen on transvaginal ultrasound].","The correct answer is a. laparoscopy. Surgery should be offered to women who have certain indications, such as significant pain, an adnexal mass ≥35 mm, a visible fetal heartbeat on scan, or a serum hcg level ≥5000 iu/l. A laparoscopic approach is preferable, and a salpingectomy should be performed unless the woman has other risk factors for infertility, in which case a salpingotomy should be undertaken. Hcg measurements alone are not sufficient for determining the next step in management, as they can be inconclusive in cases where the hcg levels are high or there is no intrauterine gestational sac visible on ultrasound. Ultrasound alone is not enough to confirm the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy either. Laparotomy, or open surgery, is a more invasive option and should not be the initial step in management. Culdo-centhesis is not recommended as it is an outdated and potentially dangerous technique. Therefore, laparoscopy is the next appropriate step for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the woman has had several recent sexual partners, which increases her risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia. Additionally, the symptom of post-coital bleeding on gentle contact is commonly associated with cervicitis. Choices a (cervical cancer), b (cervical ectropion), c (cin), and e (gonococcal cervicitis) are less likely as they do not typically present with post-coital bleeding. However, it is important for the woman to seek medical attention in order to obtain a correct diagnosis and treatment.",d,d,TRUE,
1271. a 68yo woman presents with post-coital bleeding following her first episode of sexual intercourse in 10yrs. what is the single most likely cause that has led to post-coital bleeding?,a. endometrial ca,b. atrophic vaginitis,c. endometrial polyp,d. cervical ca,e. cervical ectropion,,,,,,key: the key is b. atrophic vaginitis.,"The correct answer for the most likely cause that has led to post-coital bleeding in a 68-year-old woman after her first episode of sexual intercourse in 10 years is atrophic vaginitis. Atrophic vaginitis is a condition where the vaginal walls become thin, dry, and inflamed due to decreased levels of estrogen. This condition can cause vaginal dryness, itching, burning, discomfort or pain during intercourse, and post-coital bleeding. Endometrial cancer and cervical cancer can also cause post-coital bleeding, but they are less likely in this case since the woman has not had sexual intercourse for a long time. Endometrial polyps and cervical ectropion may also cause post-coital bleeding, but they are less likely in this case since the woman is older and has not had sexual intercourse for a long time. Therefore, the most likely cause of post-coital bleeding in this case is atrophic vaginitis.",b,b,TRUE,

[previous pud is a risk factor for tubal pregnancy].,"The most probable diagnosis for the 28-year-old woman with vaginal bleeding, rigid abdomen, low blood pressure, and high heart rate is tubal pregnancy (choice d). This is particularly likely given the patient’s history of previous pelvic inflammatory disease, which is a risk factor for tubal pregnancy. Choice a, threatened abortion, would not cause these more severe symptoms. Choice b, miscarriage, and choice c, missed abortion, typically involve spontaneous abortion of the fetus and are unlikely to cause the rigidity in the patient’s abdomen or the significant drop in blood pressure. Choice e, inevitable abortion, may cause vaginal bleeding and a drop in blood pressure, but would not typically cause the rigidity and high heart rate seen in this patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is tubal pregnancy, which requires urgent medical attention to prevent life-threatening complications.",d,d,TRUE,

[35% of childhood uti is associated with vur and many of them develop renal scarring and chronic pyelonephritis causing hypertension].,"The most likely cause of the patient's high blood pressure is chronic pyelonephritis, which is associated with renal scarring and hypertension. This is supported by her history of repeated childhood UTIs, which is a common risk factor for chronic pyelonephritis. Essential hypertension (choice A) is unlikely given her young age and the presence of a specific underlying condition. Acute pyelonephritis (choice C) may cause a temporary increase in blood pressure, but would not be the cause of chronic hypertension. Pre-eclampsia (choice D) typically occurs in the third trimester and would not be present at 16 weeks gestation. Chronic UTI (choice E) may be a contributing factor, but is not the most likely cause of her hypertension. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.",b,b,TRUE,

[d/d: ectopic pregnancy, renal colic, torsion of ovarian cyst, appendicitis etc. transvaginal us will give better results in case of lower abdominal pain].","The most appropriate test to investigate the cause of acute abdominal pain in a 24-year-old woman who is 10 weeks pregnant and has been experiencing lower abdominal pain for 12 hours is transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). TVUS is the preferred imaging modality for pregnant women with acute lower abdominal pain as it can diagnose various conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, renal colic, torsion of ovarian cyst, and appendicitis with greater accuracy compared to abdominal ultrasound or other laboratory tests such as CBC and anti-phospholipid screening. Laparoscopy is an invasive procedure and should only be considered if the results of TVUS are inconclusive, or urgent surgical intervention is required. Thus, the correct answer is option D.",d,d,TRUE,

[till ctg is normal we should not switch to other option but continuing ctg. if ctg shows fetal distress then we have to do fetal scalp blood sampling to take decision about probable cesarean section. (only abnormal ctg is not enough to take decision of cesarean section)].,"The correct answer to this question is b. CTG, as the laboring patient's cervix is only 3cm dilated and the CTG is currently normal. It is important to continue monitoring the CTG until it shows fetal distress, which may require further evaluation such as fetal scalp blood sampling to determine the need for a possible cesarean section. However, it is not appropriate to jump to a decision for a cesarean section based on the presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid alone, as the CTG must also indicate fetal distress. BP monitoring is not relevant to this scenario, and internal rotation is not a valid option for this particular situation.",b,b,TRUE,
1276. a pt is at term and labor. the head has been delivered and you suspect shoulder dystocia. what is the single most appropriate action?,a. c-section,b. episiotomy,c. external rotation,d. fetal scalp blood sample,e. instrumental delivery,,,,,,key: the key is b. episiotomy.,"The correct answer for this question is B, episiotomy. An episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the area surrounding the vagina during childbirth to expand the opening and allow the baby to be delivered safely. In cases of shoulder dystocia, where the baby's shoulder is stuck behind the mother's pelvic bone, an episiotomy can ease the delivery by providing more space for the baby to pass through. Options A, C, D, and E are inappropriate for this situation because a c-section involves delivering the baby through a surgical incision on the mother's abdomen, external rotation is not effective in cases of severe shoulder dystocia, a fetal scalp blood sample does not address the issue of shoulder dystocia, and an instrumental delivery may exacerbate the problem. Therefore, an episiotomy is the most appropriate action because it can reduce the risks associated with shoulder dystocia and facilitate the safe delivery of the baby.",b,b,TRUE,

CTG shows fetal tachycardia. The single most appropriate treatment in this case is to recommend a fiber diet. Constipation is common during pregnancy and changes to the diet and lifestyle, including a high fiber diet, plenty of fluids, and regular exercise, are often the first-line treatments recommended. Oral laxatives and phosphate enemas should be avoided during pregnancy unless necessary and under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Lactulose is a laxative that may be considered if dietary changes fail to relieve constipation, but it should only be used after consulting with a healthcare provider. Reassurance alone is not appropriate management for this patient's condition. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",b,b,TRUE,
1278. a 16yo girl presents with heavy bleeding. what is the most appropriate initial inv?,a. endometrial sampling,b. transvaginal us,c. hysteroscopy,d. pelvic us,e. exam under anesthesia,,,,,,key: the key is d. pelvic us. [pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound are same thing].,"The correct answer is d. pelvic ultrasound. This test is the most appropriate initial investigation for a 16-year-old girl with heavy bleeding as it can reveal any structural abnormalities in the pelvic region, such as fibroids or tumors, and assess the thickness of the endometrial lining to rule out conditions like endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Endometrial sampling, hysteroscopy, and exam under anesthesia are invasive procedures that are not suitable for a first-line investigation. Transvaginal ultrasound is also a suitable option, but it is essentially the same as pelvic ultrasound with the only difference being the route of the ultrasound probe. Therefore, pelvic ultrasound is the most appropriate initial investigation for a 16-year-old girl with heavy bleeding.",d,d,TRUE,

[termination is the last resort! before it iv hydrocortisone is tried. 1st oral antiemetics if fail perenteral antiemetics if fail iv hydrocortisone. last resort is termination].,"The correct answer for this question is e. IV hydrocortisone. Termination of pregnancy should be the last resort for treating excessive and severe vomiting during pregnancy. Before considering termination, oral antiemetics should be tried first, followed by parenteral antiemetics if they fail. However, since the patient is unable to take oral fluids and is complaining of severe headache, IV therapy with corticosteroids like hydrocortisone can be helpful in managing her symptoms. TPN and feeds via NGT are not appropriate in this scenario. P6 acupressure may provide some relief, but it is not as effective as IV hydrocortisone. In summary, IV hydrocortisone is the most appropriate management for this patient's excessive and severe vomiting and headache, considering termination should only be considered as a last resort.",e,e,TRUE,

PCOS can be ruled out because it is typically characterized by increased LH, increased FSH, and normal estrogen, with an LH:FSH ratio of 2:1 or 3:1. POF is also unlikely as it presents with raised levels of both LH and FSH, with FSH levels exceeding 20 IU/L. Absent ovaries would result in low levels of estradiol and high levels of both FSH and LH. Turner’s syndrome would present with gonadal streaks and absent ovaries. Therefore, the absence of a uterus is the most likely cause of primary amenorrhea in this patient, given her normal hormone levels.",c,c,TRUE,

[high lh, high or normal fsh with slight rise in prolactin levels in an obese lady is suggestive of pcos].","The correct answer for this case is a) PCOS. PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, which is characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and ovarian dysfunction. In this case, the high levels of LH and normal FSH in an obese lady, along with a slightly elevated prolactin level, are indicative of a classic presentation of PCOS. The elevated LH levels suggest an increased release of androgens from the ovary, leading to symptoms such as acne, hirsutism, and irregular periods. On the other hand, the slightly raised prolactin levels may be a result of the altered estrogens levels seen in PCOS. The other options such as pregnancy, hypothyroidism, and primary obesity can be ruled out based on the hormonal profile and clinical presentation. Therefore, PCOS is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",a,a,TRUE,

[high lh and fsh, normal prolactin and low estrogen in secondary amenorrhea in a lady under age 40 is highly suggestive of pof].","The correct answer to this question is b. premature ovarian failure (POF). POF is characterized by high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), low levels of estrogen, and absence of menstrual periods. The condition typically occurs in women under the age of 40 and can be caused by genetic or autoimmune factors. PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and menopause can all present with similar symptoms, but the high levels of LH and FSH in conjunction with low estrogen levels make POF the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

[patient is alcoholic. on admission abstinence from alcohol caused this withdrawal symptom. agitation, confusion and pick at things are suggestive of delirium tremens which is treated with diazepam].","The correct answer is a. diazepam. This patient is an alcoholic and the symptoms described are suggestive of delirium tremens, which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. Diazepam is commonly used to treat these symptoms and help the patient to calm down. Chlordiazepoxide is also a benzodiazepine that can be used for alcohol withdrawal, but it is not the correct answer in this case. Thiamine and vitamin B are supplements that may be useful for treating alcohol withdrawal, but they are not used specifically for delirium tremens. Therefore, the correct answer is a. diazepam.",a,a,TRUE,
1284. a 65yo lady presents with dyspareunia. what will you give her for her condition?,a. hrt,b. cocp,c. estrogen gel,d. testosterone gel,,,,,,,key: no key is given. likely key is c. estrogen gel. [seems to be atrophic vaginitis for which estrogen gel can be given].,"A 65-year-old woman presenting with dyspareunia is likely experiencing atrophic vaginitis, for which estrogen gel is a recommended treatment. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and combination oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may also contain estrogen and potentially be effective, but they come with additional risks and considerations that must be discussed with the patient. Testosterone gel is not typically used to treat atrophic vaginitis. Therefore, the correct answer is C, estrogen gel, because it is the safest and most effective option for the patient's condition.",c,c,TRUE,
1285. a 35yo lady with subserosal fibroid=4cm and submural fibroid=6cm is planning for a child. which way will you remove the fibroids?,a. laproscopy,b. vaginal myomectomy,c. abdominal myomectomy,d. drugs,e. reassure,,,,,,key: the key is b. vaginal myomectomy. probably wrong key! correct key should be c. abdominal myomectomy. [subserosal fibroid is not suitable to treat through vaginal route. abdominal myomectomy can deal with both subserosal and submural fibroid].,"The correct answer to this question is c. abdominal myomectomy. This is because subserosal fibroids, which the patient has, are not suitable for treatment via the vaginal route. Abdominal myomectomy is the best option as it can treat both subserosal and submural fibroids. Laparoscopy may not be effective due to the size of the fibroids, and drugs are not a permanent solution. Reassurance would not address the patient's concern of wanting to have a child. Therefore, an abdominal myomectomy would be the optimal choice for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,

[cocp will not resolve the case. there is no fibroid so no myomectomy. endometrial ablation may render the young lady non fertile. so uae is the only suitable option here].,"The correct answer for the management of a 32-year-old woman presenting with heavy blood loss and uterine thickness greater than 14mm is b. UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization). This is because COCP (Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill) will not resolve the issue, as there is no fibroid present. Hysteroscopy myomectomy and abdominal myomectomy are also not suitable options as there is no mention of a fibroid. Endometrial ablation may stop the heavy blood loss, but it renders the woman non-fertile. UAE is the only effective and suitable option for managing heavy blood loss in this case, as it selectively cuts off the blood supply to the affected area of the uterus, reducing its thickness and stopping the heavy blood loss. Therefore, UAE is the best possible management for this case.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the patient's symptoms, including sudden loss of vision and swollen retinas, are indicative of a blockage within the central retinal vein. Option a, branch rvo, and option b, branch rao, refer to occlusions in the branches of the retinal vein and artery, respectively, rather than the central vessels. Option c, crao, is an occlusion of the central retinal artery, which causes a different type of visual impairment. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is crvo, as it aligns with the patient's presentation and symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,

This is because the symptoms are indicative of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), which is common in young children. The clean catch urine specimen for culture test helps to identify the type of bacteria causing the UTI and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment. Option A, catheter specimen of urine for culture, may cause discomfort and potential complications in young children, and is generally reserved for hospital settings. Option C, CBC, is a nonspecific test that may help identify signs of infection and inflammation, but it cannot confirm a UTI. Options D and E, KUB US and supra-pubic aspirate of urine for culture, respectively, are more invasive and are generally not used as first-line investigations for a suspected UTI in young children.",b,b,TRUE,

[not compliant with medicine, eating a lot, thinking of being short and being unhappy these are psychological issues. so he should be referred to psychologist].","The correct answer for this question is option A, which suggests referring the child to a psychologist. This is because the child is experiencing psychological issues such as unhappiness, body image concerns, and non-compliance with medication, which can all negatively impact their overall health. The other options such as referring to a pediatrician, GP, or social services may not address the underlying psychological issues the child is facing. Additionally, changing the type of insulin may not solve the problem of non-compliance and extra eating. Therefore, the best approach would be to refer the child to a psychologist who specializes in treating children with chronic medical conditions like T1DM, and can help the child manage their emotions, behavior, and self-care.",a,a,TRUE,

[the boy had glycosuria while treating in hospital following a mvc (motor vehical crush). it may be due to stress related cortisol release cousing hyperglycemia which later became nil as the boy recovered from trauma. but yet to certain that he is not diabetic fasting blood glucose concentration should be done in follow up visit].,"The single most appropriate follow-up investigation for the 8-year-old boy who had glycosuria following a motor vehicle crash is a fasting blood glucose concentration test. Although the glycosuria resolved after the boy recovered from his injury, it is still important to rule out the possibility of underlying diabetes. Fasting blood glucose concentration test is the best indicator of diabetes as it measures the blood glucose level after an overnight fast. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test represents the average blood glucose concentration over a longer period of time, and therefore is not recommended in this case. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) involves drinking a glucose solution and measuring blood sugar levels several times, and the test may not be necessary in this case given the boy's age and absence of symptoms suggestive of diabetes. Random blood glucose concentration and serum cortisol concentration tests may not provide a definitive diagnosis in this case. Therefore, a fasting blood glucose concentration test is the most appropriate follow-up investigation.",a,a,TRUE,

[congenital infections affect the unborn fetus or newborn infant. they are generally caused by viruses that may be picked up by the baby at any time during the pregnancy up through the time of delivery. the more common viruses linked to congenital infections include the cytomegalovirus (cmv), herpes, rubella (german measles), parvovirus, varicella (chickenpox), and enteroviruses].","The most likely diagnosis for a baby boy with hepato-splenomegaly, a rash, and elevated levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes at birth is a congenital viral infection. Congenital infections can be caused by viruses that are picked up by the baby during pregnancy or at the time of delivery. The common viruses linked to congenital infections include cytomegalovirus, herpes, rubella, parvovirus, varicella, and enteroviruses. Therefore, option (e) is the correct answer. Galactosemia would present with poor feeding, lethargy, hypoglycemia, and jaundice. Biliary atresia presents with jaundice and pale stools. G6PD deficiency would present with anemia and jaundice. Rh incompatibility would present with anemia, jaundice, and enlarged spleen. None of these options present with the same set of symptoms as congenital viral infection.",e,e,TRUE,

[probable diabetic ketoacidosis. initial treatment is iv fluid (0.9% saline)].,"The correct answer to this question is E, saline 0.9% IV. Based on the information given, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. The first step in treating DKA is to restore the patient's fluid balance and replace electrolytes that may be lost due to vomiting or frequent urination. This is typically done with intravenous fluids, and 0.9% saline is the most appropriate choice in this case. Options A and B (albumin IV and bicarbonate IV) may be used in some cases of DKA, but they are not the most important initial treatments. Option C (insulin IV) is a critical component of DKA management, but it must be given after fluid resuscitation has been started to prevent severe hypoglycemia. Option D (insulin SC) is not indicated in the acute setting of DKA because it takes too long to take effect. Therefore, the best answer is E, saline 0.9% IV, as it is the most important initial treatment in this patient.",e,e,TRUE,

[ivct (inferior venacaval thrombosis) is well known to occur secondary to dvt leading to dilated tortuous veins crossing the abdomen to join the tributaries to svc].,"The correct answer to this question is e. DVT. IVCT (inferior venacaval thrombosis) is a known complication of DVT, which can lead to the dilation and tortuosity of veins that cross the abdomen to join the tributaries to the SVC. In contrast, intra-abdominal malignancies, ovarian cysts, fibroids, and ascites are not typically associated with this presentation. Therefore, DVT is the most likely cause for the patient's symptoms. It is essential to consider the correct diagnosis because prompt intervention can prevent further complications and improve patient outcomes.",e,e,TRUE,

[in early disease, the macula shows yellowish-colored subretinal deposits called “drusen”].","The correct answer to the question is a) macular degeneration. The presence of subretinal deposits called ""drusen"" in the macula is a characteristic feature of early macular degeneration. These yellowish spots, along with other symptoms like blurred vision, darkened areas or distortion in central vision, are indicative of damage to the macula, a small but critical area in the retina responsible for sharp, clear vision. The other choices are unlikely to be the correct diagnosis based on the given information. Hypertensive retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy are associated with high blood pressure and elevated blood sugar respectively and manifest differently than macular degeneration. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system and can result in visual impairment, but this is not the most likely diagnosis given the specific symptoms described in the question. Therefore, based on the presence of drusen and yellow spots in the center of the retina, macular degeneration is the most likely diagnosis for this 84-year-old woman.",a,a,TRUE,

CRVO, or central retinal vein occlusion. This occurs when the main vein that carries blood away from the retina becomes blocked, leading to a range of symptoms including headache, blurred vision, and acuity loss. Dots and blotches may also be visible on the back of the eye, as well as a red swollen optic disc. The other answer choices are unlikely given the symptoms described. CRAO (central retinal artery occlusion) would present with sudden, painless vision loss, and a branch retinal artery occlusion would not cause such widespread symptoms. Optic atrophy would present with a pale optic disc rather than a swollen one.",c,c,TRUE,

[neovascularization suggests proliferative diabetic retinopathy which is treated with laser photocoagulation].,"In a 64-year-old diabetic patient with new vessels seen on fundoscopy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) should be suspected. The most appropriate management for PDR is laser photocoagulation, which helps to reduce the risk of vision loss and blindness by reducing the growth of abnormal new blood vessels and sealing leaking vessels. Strict sugar control and regular eye check-ups are important measures to prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy, however, in cases of PDR, early treatment with laser photocoagulation is vital to prevent irreversible vision loss. Non-urgent referral to a specialist is not appropriate in this case as prompt intervention is necessary. Therefore, option (d) laser photocoagulation is the correct answer, while options (a) strict sugar control, (b) regular eye check-ups, (c) non-urgent referral to a specialist, and (e) insulin are not the ideal management for PDR.",d,d,TRUE,

[up to 24 weeks termination of pregnancy is abortion. ref: patient.info],"The correct answer is D, abortion. Abortion refers to the termination of pregnancy before the 24th week of gestation. In this scenario, the patient is presenting with lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding and passage of clots, which are symptoms commonly associated with an abortion. The fact that the internal os is open suggests that the cervix has dilated, which is a sign of an ongoing abortion. Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix and is unlikely to present with vaginal bleeding and passage of clots. Placental abruption is a complication that occurs later in pregnancy, usually in the third trimester, and results in bleeding from the placenta. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, typically in the fallopian tube, and is unlikely given the available information in the scenario.",d,d,TRUE,

[place a hook behind the object and pull it out].,"The correct answer is a: remove with a hook. This is the most appropriate management because the rubber end of the pencil is a foreign object that needs to be removed from the man's ear. Using a hook to carefully and gently pull it out is the recommended approach. Instilling olive oil (option b) or attempting syringing (option e) may make the condition worse and is not recommended. Using a magnet instrument (option d) may not be effective if the rubber end of the pencil is not magnetic. Option c, remove ga, is not a viable option as it is not a recognized medical procedure. It is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible to avoid complications and injury to the ear.",a,a,TRUE,

Small perforations are typically able to heal on their own within 6-8 weeks, but doctors often prescribe antibiotics during this healing period to prevent infections. Admission for parental care, nasal decongestant, packing of the ear, and syringing ENT are all inappropriate management options for this scenario. Surgical intervention may be necessary in rare cases with larger perforations or persistent problems, but is not the first-line approach for a small perforation of the eardrum in this situation. An OPD review would be appropriate to ensure proper healing and follow-up care.",c,c,TRUE,

Otosclerosis. The patient in question presents with conductive hearing loss, which rules out options a. (Acoustic neuroma) and b. (Meniere's disease), as they typically present with sensorineural hearing loss. There is no history of noise pollution or age-related hearing loss (presbyacusis), making option c. unlikely. Otosclerosis fits the patient's symptoms of moderate hearing loss in both ears across all frequencies, especially given his age of 45.

[it is autosomal recessive disease. as one child is affected both parents are carrier. so in this case next child will be normal in 1:4 case, carrier in 1:2 cases and diseased in 1:4 cases].","If the biological parents of a child with CF come to me asking about the chances of their future children having the same disease, I would tell them that the correct answer is A. There is a 1:4 chance that their future child will have CF. CF is an autosomal recessive disease, meaning that both parents are carriers and have a 1 in 4 chance to pass on two recessive genes, which results in a child being affected with the disease. For unaffected children, there is a 2 in 4 chance of inheriting one mutated gene from one of the parents and a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting two normal genes from both parents, making them carriers. The incorrect choices are B, C, and D. Choice B is incorrect because unaffected children have a chance to be carriers, not necessarily all of them. Choice C is incorrect because predictions can be made based on the mode of inheritance of the disease. Choice D is incorrect because antenatal diagnosis is not 100% accurate and it is invasive and carries some risks.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because of the presentation of symptoms that suggest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and sulfasalazine is considered a first-line medication of choice for IBD. Steroids are the first preference, followed by immunosuppressants, then aminosalicylates such as sulfasalazine. Metronidazole is used if infective complications like infected perianal fistula are present. Paracetamol and ibuprofen are not appropriate for IBD management since they are pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs, but they do not specifically treat IBD.

In this case, the patient is a 62-year-old ex-shipyard worker who presents with symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain for 6 months. He now has a large pleural effusion, and the likely diagnosis is mesothelioma, which is commonly related to occupational exposure to asbestos. A pleural biopsy is the single best investigation for confirming the diagnosis of mesothelioma and determining its type.

Unlike a craniotomy, which involves removing a portion of the skull to access the affected area, burr hole drainage is less invasive and has a lower risk of complications. Conservative management, which involves observing and monitoring the hematoma without surgical intervention, is not recommended in this case given the patient's worsening symptoms. Excision and biopsy is not an appropriate treatment option for chronic subdural hematomas, as they are not typically removed entirely and a biopsy would be unnecessary as the diagnosis is already confirmed through imaging. Therefore, the most appropriate management for the patient is burr hole drainage.",b,b,TRUE,

This test is specifically administered to check for the presence or absence of the H. pylori bacterium, which has been implicated as a causal factor in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Endoscopy and biopsy (option C) are invasive procedures that may be necessary if the breath test is positive, but are not routinely done without first conducting a less invasive test. ECG (option A) and US (option D) are not relevant in this scenario and would not yield any information about the cause of epigastric discomfort. Thus, option B is the most appropriate test for this patient, as it would help to identify whether H. pylori was responsible for causing his initial symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

The patient's symptoms of umbilical pain, anorexia, nausea, and no bowel movement for 24 hours indicate the possibility of an inflamed appendix. Meckel’s diverticulum typically presents with painless rectal bleeding and is less common in teenagers. IBD and IBS are chronic conditions and do not present with acute symptoms like the ones described in this case. Muscle strain, ovarian cysts, Psoas hematoma, pyelonephritis, and ureteric calculus can present with similar symptoms but these are less likely in this case because the pain is centered around the umbilicus. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for this 13yo boy is acute appendicitis and prompt medical attention is necessary.",a,a,TRUE,

This is indicated by the presence of a short PR interval and a slurred delta wave. SVT (answer choice a) and atrial fibrillation (answer choice d) can cause tachycardia, but they would not produce the same ECG findings as wpw syndrome. VT (answer choice b) would typically present with a wide QRS complex and a different pattern on the ECG. Mobitz I heart block (answer choice c) would present with a progressively lengthening PR interval before a dropped beat, which is not evident in this ECG. Therefore, based on the information provided, wpw syndrome is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.",e,e,TRUE,

Magnesium sulfate is a bronchodilatory agent that can be effective at reducing airway resistance in patients with severe asthma. IV aminophylline (choice a) and IV salbutamol (choice c) are also bronchodilators, but they have a higher risk of adverse effects and are generally reserved for more refractory cases. IM adrenaline (choice d) and IV adrenaline (choice e) are not indicated in the treatment of acute asthma as they may worsen airway constriction and cause cardiovascular side effects.",b,b,TRUE,

Specifically, the picture suggests amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with bulbar onset, which is a type of motor neuron disease. A cerebral tumor, myasthenia gravis, lambert-eaton syndrome, and cerebro-vascular disease can present with similar symptoms, but they are less likely given the combination of symptoms described in the case. Cerebral tumor and cerebro-vascular disease would likely cause other neurological symptoms in addition to weakness and difficulty swallowing. Myasthenia gravis and lambert-eaton syndrome are neuromuscular disorders and typically cause more localized muscle weakness, rather than progressive weakness that spreads throughout the body. Overall, the most likely diagnosis is motor neuron disease, specifically ALS with bulbar onset, which has a poor prognosis.",d,d,TRUE,
1310. a 10yo boy with lower abdominal pain for the last 10d presents with a hx of passing 6-8 loose stools. temp=38.8c. he is tender in the right lower quadrant and has an anal fistula. choose the single most likely cause of abdominal pain.,a. ibd,b. ibs,c. pyelonephritis,d. uretric calculus,e. gastroenteritis,,,,,,key: the key is a. ibd. [likely diagnosis is crohn’s disease which is often associated with perianal fistula formation].,"The single most likely cause of abdominal pain in this 10-year-old boy with a history of lower abdominal pain for the last 10 days, passing 6-8 loose stools, a temperature of 38.8°C, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and an anal fistula is A) IBD (Crohn's disease), which is often associated with perianal fistula formation. While the other options such as IBS, pyelonephritis, ureteric calculus, and gastroenteritis may also cause abdominal pain, they do not specifically match the patient's symptoms and presentation. IBS typically presents with abdominal pain, often relieved by defecation and changes in bowel habits; pyelonephritis and ureteric calculus are associated with urinary symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, and suprapubic tenderness; and gastroenteritis typically presents with diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and history, IBD (Crohn's disease) is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
1311. a 28yo woman with hx of drug addiction wants to start a family and have a baby. she would like to stop taking heroin and asked for something to help her stay away from it. what drug tx would you give her?,a. naloxone,b. acamprosate,c. methadone,d. chlordiazepoxide,e. naltrexone,,,,,,key: the key is c. methadone. [methadone is a powerful synthetic analgesic drug which is similar to morphine in its effects but less sedative and is used as a substitute drug in the treatment of morphine and heroin addiction].,"The correct answer is c. Methadone. Methadone is a synthetic analgesic drug that is similar to morphine and less sedative. It is commonly used as a substitute drug in the treatment of morphine and heroin addiction. Methadone helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms and decrease drug cravings, making it easier for the patient to stay away from heroin. The other answer choices are incorrect. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is used to reverse the effects of opioids in emergency situations. Acamprosate is used to treat alcohol dependence. Chlordiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Naltrexone is another opioid antagonist used to prevent relapse in alcoholics and opioid-dependent patients.",c,c,TRUE,
1312. a pt with vesicles in the maxillary divison of trigeminal nerve. which area of mucus membrane will be involved?,a. palate,b. cheek,c. cornea,d. conjunctiva,,,,,,,key: the key is b. cheek. [it also involve soft palate but not hard palate. so cheek is more complete answer than palate. conjuctiva is more affected in ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve].,"If a patient has vesicles in the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, the area of mucous membrane that will be involved is likely the cheek. While the soft palate may also be affected, it is not the most complete answer as the question specifically mentions the involvement of the maxillary division. The cornea is not a mucous membrane and is part of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, which is not involved in this scenario. The conjunctiva may be affected in the ophthalmic division, but it is not relevant to this particular case. Therefore, the best answer is b. cheek.",b,b,TRUE,
1313. a 52yo man presents with visual hallucinations and features of cognitive impairment. what is the most likely dx?,a. frontotemporal dementia,b. lewy body dementia,c. delirium tremens,d. alzheimer’s disease,e. huntington’s disease,,,,,,key: the key is b. lewy body dementia. [visual hallucinations and cognitive impairment are suggestive of lewy body dementia. hallucination is prominent feature of lbd than alzheimers. again cognitive impairment goes more with lbd while prominent early memory loss symptom suggests alzheimer’s].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 52-year-old man presenting with visual hallucinations and cognitive impairment is option B: Lewy body dementia. This is because these symptoms are characteristic of Lewy body dementia, with visual hallucinations being a more prominent feature than in Alzheimer's disease, which also presents with cognitive impairment. Frontotemporal dementia is associated with personality and behavior changes, and Huntington's disease typically presents with motor symptoms. Delirium tremens is associated with alcohol withdrawal and presents with confusion, disorientation, and tremors, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Lewy body dementia, and the other options are less likely based on the presenting symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
"1314. a 40yo woman who has recently returned from working in the middle east complains of thirst, episode of loin pain, urinary frequency, dysuria and has passed a urinary stone. all inv are normal. she plans to return to the middle east in a month’s time. what is the single best advice to prevent recurrent stone formation?",a. drink less milk,b. high fibre diet,c. increase fluid intake,d. low calcium diet,e. low protein diet,,,,,,"key: the key is c. increased fluid intake. [ risk factors for renal stones include being overweight, certain foods, some medications, and not drinking enough fluids].","The correct answer is c, which is to increase fluid intake. The risk factors for developing renal stones include being overweight, certain foods, some medications, and not drinking enough fluids. In this case, the woman has recently returned from working in the middle east and has already experienced a urinary stone. Therefore, it is essential to advise her to increase her fluid intake to prevent recurrent stone formation. This is because dehydration can cause urine to become highly concentrated, allowing minerals to crystallize and form stones. The other options, such as drinking less milk, a high fiber diet, a low calcium diet, or a low protein diet, are not the best advice for preventing renal stone formation. While they may contribute to overall health, increasing fluid intake is the most effective way to prevent recurrent renal stone formation.",c,c,TRUE,
1315. a 32yo man presents with 3d of scrotal pain. exam: thickening o the left testis and it is hot to touch. what is the most appropriate management?,a. analgesia,b. reassurance,c. antibiotics,d. referral to surgeon,,,,,,,"key: the key is c. antibiotics. [scrotal pain of 3 days with thickening of testis which is hot to touch suggests epididymoorchitis, which is treated with antibiotics].","The correct answer for the management of a 32-year-old man presenting with scrotal pain, and thickening of the left testis that is hot to touch is antibiotics (choice C). This presentation is suggestive of epididymoorchitis, which is inflammation or infection of the epididymis and testis. The infection can be caused by sexually transmitted organisms or bacteria from the urinary tract. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for epididymoorchitis, and analgesia (choice A) alone is not sufficient. Reassurance (choice B) may be appropriate, but it should not be the only management plan. Referral to a surgeon (choice D) is not necessary in the initial management of epididymoorchitis. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is antibiotics with reassurance and analgesia as supportive measures.",c,c,TRUE,
"1316. a 34yo woman presents with truncal obesity, easy bruising, hyperglycemia, high bp and depression. which of the following inv’s will be most helpful in localizing the cause for cushing’s syndrome?",a. serum cortisol,b. 24h urinary cortisol,c. low dose dexamethasone suppression test,d. high dose dexamethasone suppression test,e. overnight dexamethasone suppression test,,,,,,key: the key is d. high dose dexamethasone suppression test. [high dose dexamethasone suppression test can identify whether pituitary adenoma or ectopic acth producing tumour].,"The most helpful investigation to localize the cause for Cushing's syndrome in a 34-year-old woman with truncal obesity, easy bruising, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, and depression is the high dose dexamethasone suppression test. This test can differentiate between Cushing's disease, caused by a pituitary adenoma, and ectopic ACTH-producing tumors, as it suppresses cortisol levels in patients with a pituitary adenoma but not in those with an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor. Serum cortisol and the 24-hour urinary cortisol tests are not specific enough to differentiate between the different causes of Cushing's syndrome, while the low dose dexamethasone suppression test may miss patients with mild Cushing's disease. The overnight dexamethasone suppression test is less sensitive than the high dose test and may also miss mild cases of Cushing's disease. Therefore, the high dose dexamethasone suppression test is the most appropriate test to identify the cause of Cushing's syndrome in this patient.",d,d,TRUE,
1317. a 32yo man develops hematuria 2wks after a sore throat. what is the dx?,a. post infection nephritis,b. iga nephropathy,c. membranous nephritis,d. glomerulonephritis,,,,,,,key: the key is a. post infection nephritis. [hematuria 2 wks after sorethroat indicate post infection nephritis while hematuria after few days of sorethroat indicate iga nephropathy].,"The correct answer is a. post-infection nephritis. Hematuria occurring 2 weeks after a sore throat is indicative of post-infection nephritis. This occurs due to an immune response to a streptococcal infection in which antigens from the bacteria trigger a reaction that damages the glomeruli of the kidneys, leading to hematuria. The other choices are incorrect because hematuria occurring after a few days of a sore throat is indicative of IgA nephropathy, which is a different condition altogether, and membranous nephritis and glomerulonephritis are not typically associated with a recent sore throat.",a,a,TRUE,
"1318. an elder man who has anorexia, prostate symptoms and htn. there are small kidneys on us. what is the dx?",a. hypertensive renal disease,b. prostate ca,c. bph,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. hyperensive renal disease. [small kidneys suggest chronic renal failure and uremia here is the cause of anorexia. as elder he may have associated prostate symptoms from concomitant bph].,"The correct answer is A, hypertensive renal disease. The small kidneys on the ultrasound suggest chronic renal failure and uremia may be causing the anorexia. The prostate symptoms are likely due to concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is common in older men. Prostate cancer (choice B) would not be suggested by the clinical presentation or imaging findings. Choice C, BPH, is a plausible diagnosis, but it does not explain the small kidneys or anorexia. Therefore, choice A is the most likely diagnosis based on the given information.",a,a,TRUE,
"1319. a 55yo woman with breast ca which has spread to lung, liver and bone now presents with increasing constipation, weakness, thirst and anorexia for the past 3d. her only medication is haloperidol for hiccoughs. today she is disorientated and has left sided weakness. what is the most likely dx?",a. brain mets,b. hypercalcemia,c. liver failure,,,,,,,,"key: the key is a. brain mets. [the patient has clinical hypercalcemia, but the neurological features of disorientation and left sided weakness can only be explained with brain metastasis].","The most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is a. brain metastasis. This is because despite having a previous breast cancer diagnosis that has spread to lung, liver, and bone, the neurological symptoms of disorientation and left-sided weakness cannot be explained by the metastasis to those areas. Additionally, the patient is showing signs of clinical hypercalcemia, which is a common complication of cancer, but hypercalcemia alone cannot explain the neurological symptoms that the patient is experiencing. Liver failure is a possibility, but it is less likely to cause the neurological symptoms that are present in this case. Therefore, brain metastasis is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's clinical presentation.",a,a,TRUE,
"1320. a 22yo man presents with a red, hot, swollen, metatarsal phalangeal joint, sarcoilitis and onycholysis. what is the single most likely cause of his condition?",a. gout,b. ra,c. reiter’s syndrome,d. psoriatic arthropathy,,,,,,,key: the key is d. psoriatic arthropathy. [psoriatic arthritis initially can affects the toes very similar to gout. there can be sacroilitis and onycholysis. ref: patient.info].,"The single most likely cause of this 22-year-old man's condition is psoriatic arthropathy (answer d). Psoriatic arthritis initially presents with symptoms very similar to gout, including redness, heat, and swelling in the toes. Additionally, this condition can cause sacroiliitis and onycholysis, which are also present in this case. While rheumatoid arthritis (answer b) can also cause joint inflammation and damage, it typically affects older individuals and is less likely in a 22-year-old. Reiter's syndrome (answer c) typically presents with urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis, which are not present in this case. Therefore, based on the symptoms described, psoriatic arthropathy is the most likely cause of this 22-year-old man's condition.",d,d,TRUE,
1321. which of the following conditions requires operative management?,a. cellulitis,b. dyshidrosi,c. erysipelas,d. fournier’s gangrene,e. lymphangitis,,,,,,key: the key is d. fournier’s gangrene. [fournier's gangrene: a horrendous infection of the genitalia that causes severe pain in the genital area (in the penis and scrotum or perineum) and progresses from erythema (redness) to necrosis (death) of tissue. gangrene can occur within hours].,"The correct answer is D. Fournier's Gangrene. Fournier's gangrene is a severe infection of the genitalia that causes excruciating pain and can rapidly progress to tissue death. It requires urgent surgical intervention to remove the necrotic tissue and prevent the spread of the infection. Cellulitis, dyshidrosis, erysipelas, and lymphangitis may not require immediate surgery, as they can often be treated with antibiotics or other non-surgical interventions. Therefore, options A, B, C, and E are incorrect. In summary, Fournier's Gangrene is the only condition listed that requires operative management due to its aggressive progression and potential for tissue death.",d,d,TRUE,
1322. a 55yo pt presents with collapse and complains of abdominal pain that radiates to the back. an expansile abdominal mass is felt on examination and the pt is in shock. what is the single most likely dx?,a. ruptured aortic aneurysm,b. renal colic,c. trauma,d. endocarditis,e. atheroma,,,,,,key: the key is a. ruptured aortic aneurysm.,"The answer to this question is a ruptured aortic aneurysm. This is because the patient is presenting with collapse and abdominal pain that radiates to the back, and an expansile abdominal mass is observed during examination. These are classic signs of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention. The other options, such as renal colic, trauma, endocarditis, and atheroma, do not typically present with these same symptoms and physical exam findings, making them less likely diagnoses in this case. Therefore, a ruptured aortic aneurysm is the most likely diagnosis and urgent referral to a vascular surgeon is critical for the patient's survival.",a,a,TRUE,

This patient has severe COPD and chronic hypoxemia, as indicated by the low pao2 level. LTOT should be prescribed in patients with chronic hypoxemia when the pao2 is consistently at or below 7.3 kpa (55 mmHg) when breathing air during a period of clinical stability. The patient is also breathless at rest, indicating a need for immediate intervention. The other choices, aminophylline, ACEI, antibiotic, and steroid, are not appropriate additional treatments for this patient's condition and would not address the underlying problem of chronic hypoxemia. Additionally, aminophylline and steroids may exacerbate the patient's hypercapnia, further worsening their respiratory status. Therefore, oxygen therapy is the most appropriate additional treatment for this patient.",d,d,TRUE,

[ingunal hernia lies mostly above and medial (occasionally lateral particularly when small) to pubic tubercle. it first enters the inguinal canal through deep inguinal ring and then enters the scrotum through the superficial inguinal ring].,"The correct answer to the question is e. passes through the deep inguinal ring. This is because an indirect inguinal hernia, which is what the patient in question has, passes through both the deep and superficial inguinal rings. Answer a. is incorrect because a femoral hernia passes through the femoral ring, which is located lower in the groin than the inguinal ring. Answer b. is incorrect because an indirect inguinal hernia does pass through the deep inguinal ring. Answer c. is incorrect because an indirect inguinal hernia lies mostly above and medial to the pubic tubercle, not below and lateral. Answer d. is incorrect because while an indirect inguinal hernia does pass through the superficial inguinal ring, it also passes through the deep inguinal ring which is a defining feature of this type of hernia.",e,e,TRUE,
"1325. a 56yo woman with hx of breast cancer 10y ago has undergone radical mastectomy and axillary ln removal, now complains of swollen upper limb 3wks after an insect bite. the bite site is better but gross edema is still present. what is the cause?",a. lymphedema,b. breast ca,c. allergy,d. filariasis,,,,,,,"key: the key is a. lymphedema. [as during mastectomy axillary clearance is done, lymphatics on that upper limb is compromised. so there occurs lymphedema].","The correct answer is a. lymphedema. This is because during a mastectomy with axillary clearance, the lymphatic system in the affected upper limb can become compromised and result in lymphedema. In this case, the insect bite may have triggered the swelling but the persistent edema suggests an underlying lymphatic issue. The other choices are not necessarily linked to the patient's history and presentation. Breast cancer is not a direct cause of edema, allergies typically cause localized swelling and filariasis is not a common condition in this patient population. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is lymphedema caused by the previous surgery and axillary lymph node removal.",a,a,TRUE,

[this is wernicke’s encephalopathy due to alcohol withdrawal, so vit b complex should be given. this occurs mainly due to thiamine deficiency].","The correct answer to this question is b. vit b complex. This presentation is indicative of Wernicke's encephalopathy due to alcohol withdrawal which can lead to thiamine deficiency. The symptoms of ataxic gait, nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia are all characteristic of the condition. While this patient's blood sugar level is high, he had a negative alcohol breath test ruling out alcohol as the cause of his symptoms. Therefore, iv insulin (a) and iv dextrose (d) are not indicated. Bolus iv 0.9%NS (c) may be helpful in treating hypotension but does not address the underlying issue. Additionally, antibiotics (e) are not indicated as there is no evidence of infection. The most important initial intervention in this case is to provide the patient with vit b complex to address the thiamine deficiency causing Wernicke's encephalopathy.",b,b,TRUE,
1327. a 34yo man has supra-orbital pain and tenderness and developed tenderness over the maxilla. he also has mild fever. what is the single likely cause for these symptoms?,a. acute sinusitis,b. gca,c. trigeminal neuralgia,d. maxillary carcinoma,,,,,,,key: the key is a. acute sinusitis. [there is supraorbital pain in frontal sinusitis and tenderness over maxilla in maxillary sinusitis. also mild fever may present in acute sinusitis].,"Based on the presented symptoms, the likely cause for the 34-year-old man is acute sinusitis. Acute sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses caused by viral or bacterial infections. The pain and tenderness in the supra-orbital and maxillary areas, as well as the mild fever, are all symptoms commonly associated with acute sinusitis, making it the most likely diagnosis. Option b, gca, or giant cell arteritis, is a systemic condition that affects the arteries of elderly patients and is characterized by headaches, facial pain, and visual disturbances. Option c, trigeminal neuralgia, is a neurological disorder that causes severe facial pain. Maxillary carcinoma, option d, is a type of cancer that affects the maxillary sinus and typically presents with pain and swelling in the affected area but is not associated with supra-orbital pain or tenderness. Therefore, based on the presented symptoms, the correct answer is a, acute sinusitis.",a,a,TRUE,

[macrocytes are two types, round and oval. oval macrocytes are seen in megaloblastic anemia which occurs due to vit b12and/or folic acid deficiency. glossitis (painful tongue), angular stomatitis and smooth tongue are though characteristic feature of iron deficiency but also known feature of megaloblastic anemia. absence of koilonychea also favours megaloblastic anemia].","The correct answer to the question is b. Oval macrocytes. This is because the patient is presenting with symptoms of megaloblastic anemia, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. Oval macrocytes are a type of macrocyte that are commonly seen in megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by the presence of larger than normal red blood cells. The absence of koilonychea, a common symptom of iron deficiency anemia, also favors megaloblastic anemia. The other answer choices are incorrect because numerous blast cells are associated with leukemia, spherocytes are seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, microcytic hypochromic cells are indicative of iron deficiency anemia, mexican hat cells are seen in some types of hemolytic anemia, and erythrocytes are normal red blood cells. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the presence of oval macrocytes, the correct answer is b.",b,b,TRUE,

[the tingling and twitching of her fingers are aura and the migraine is with aura].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 24-year-old woman presenting with tingling and twitching of her fingers followed by a throbbing unilateral headache is migraine with aura. The key clue here is the presence of aura, which refers to symptoms that occur before or alongside a migraine, such as visual disturbances, sensory changes, or difficulty speaking. Tension headaches typically present with a dull, achy pain that feels like pressure on both sides of the head, and are not typically preceded by aura symptoms. Cluster headaches often involve sharp, stabbing pain around one eye, and are not associated with aura. TIA, or transient ischemic attack, is a type of mini-stroke that presents with sudden onset of neurological symptoms such as weakness or difficulty speaking, but not typically with migraine-like symptoms. SAH, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, refers to bleeding in the spaces surrounding the brain and is typically associated with sudden, severe headache and other neurological symptoms. However, the presentation here is more consistent with migraine with aura, making option (b) the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

At this stage, the patient is no longer infectious and poses no risk to others. Option A suggesting admission to the hospital is unnecessary and extreme, as most cases of chickenpox can be managed at home. Option B suggesting isolation from parents and siblings also unnecessary and impractical, as chickenpox typically affects young children who require close care and supervision. It is important to emphasize good hand hygiene and covering of lesions with clothing or non-adhesive dressings to prevent the spread of the virus.",c,c,TRUE,

[distribution of varicella zoster (chickenpox) is centripetal that is mainly on trunk. impetigo is mosty occurs centrifugally that is more on face and limbs. impetigo also has characteristic of yellow or honey coloured scrub. herpes zoster usually occurs in elderly and unlikely to occur in children].,"Based on the presented symptoms, the most likely diagnosis for the 7-year-old boy is impetigo. This is supported by the distribution of the vesicles mainly on the face and forehead, which is typical of impetigo. Additionally, the presence of crusted and non-crusted vesicles and a hot face are also consistent with impetigo. The other answer options are unlikely diagnoses because the distribution and characteristics of the lesions do not match. Varicella zoster and herpes zoster usually occur on the trunk and are more common in adults, while fungal infections and psoriasis do not typically present with vesicles. Overall, impetigo is the most likely diagnosis based on the given information.",b,b,TRUE,

[soot in the mouth and nose and noisy breathing occurs in inhalation injury where intubation of the airway is indicated].,"The single most immediate management for the 5-year-old boy who has been rescued from a burning building with 5% partial thickness burns over the arms and legs, soot in the mouth and nose, and noisy breathing is E) intubation of airway. The presence of soot in the mouth and nose and noisy breathing indicates inhalation injury, which can cause airway swelling and obstruction. Intubation of the airway should therefore be prioritized to secure a patent airway, prevent further complications, and ensure adequate oxygenation. Nebulized adrenaline and salmetarol are not appropriate management options for airway obstruction, as they do not address the underlying cause. Needle cricothyrotomy is an invasive procedure that should only be performed by trained professionals in a controlled setting and is not necessary as a first-line intervention for this patient. Oropharyngeal airway is contraindicated in patients with suspected inhalation injury because it can worsen airway obstruction by pushing soot and debris further down the airway.",e,e,TRUE,

[pancystolic murmur in sternal border without cyanosis is indicative of vsd].,"The correct answer is A, ventricular septal defect (VSD). A pancystolic murmur at the sternal border without cyanosis is a classic sign of VSD. The other options are less likely as they typically present with different symptoms. ASD (B) usually presents with a fixed split S2 and a mid or late systolic ejection murmur. TOF (C) presents with a harsh holosystolic murmur over the left sternal border and often has cyanosis. PDA (D) presents with a continuous murmur at the left infraclavicular area and typically has bounding pulses. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is VSD.",a,a,TRUE,
"1334. a woman complaining of diarrhea, abdominal pain and fatigue. all the tests are found to be normal. what is the cause?",a. somatization,b. conversion,c. hypochondriasis,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. somatization. [somatization disorder is  patients presenting with any physical symptom and frequent medical visits in spite of negative investigations].,"The correct answer to this question is a) somatization. This disorder is characterized by individuals who present with physical symptoms and frequent medical visits despite negative test results. In this case, the woman is experiencing symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fatigue, but all the tests have come back normal. This suggests that there may not be a physical cause for her symptoms and that they could be the result of somatization. The other choices are not the correct answer for this question. Conversion disorder involves neurological symptoms, such as paralysis or blindness, that have no medical explanation. Hypochondriasis is a disorder in which individuals have a preoccupation with the fear of having a serious illness or disease, even if there is no evidence to support it. So, somatization is the most appropriate answer because it matches the symptoms and the presence of negative test results.",a,a,TRUE,

This is because the patient is presenting with classic symptoms of lymphoma, such as weight loss, night sweats, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The additional finding of splenomegaly further supports this diagnosis. The other choices are unlikely because tuberculosis typically presents with respiratory symptoms and bronchial carcinoma with lung-related symptoms, whereas bronchitis usually shows cough and phlegm production. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is lymphoma, and the patient requires further evaluation and treatment based on this diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

Hepatitis B full vaccine and IG. This combination is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine helps to build up immunity to the virus, while IG (immunoglobulin) provides immediate protection against the virus until the vaccine takes effect. Option a, which is IG only, is not sufficient as the baby needs to build up long-term immunity via Hepatitis B vaccine. Option c of giving the vaccine only once is also not recommended as the vaccine requires multiple doses for maximum effectiveness. Option d of waiting to check immune status is not recommended as the baby is at risk of acquiring the virus in the meantime. Option e of giving the vaccine once and IG is also not recommended as the vaccine requires multiple doses and the combination of vaccine and IG is only given in specific circumstances like high-risk exposure.",b,b,TRUE,
1337. a man suffers from herpes zoster affecting his face. which of the following mucos membrane is to be affected?,a. cheek,b. cornea,c. conjunctiva,d. oropharynx,e. palate,,,,,,key: the key is c. conjunctiva.,"The correct answer is c. conjunctiva. Herpes zoster is a viral infection that can affect various parts of the body, including the face. The conjunctiva is a mucous membrane that covers the outer surface of the eye and the inner lining of the eyelids. It is easily affected by the virus causing redness and swelling of the eye and eye discharge. The other options are incorrect because the cheek and oropharynx are not mucous membranes, while the cornea and palate do not usually show symptoms of herpes zoster infection. Therefore, the conjunctiva is the most likely mucous membrane to be affected in this case.",c,c,TRUE,
1338. a 34yo man sustains a fx to shaft of femur after falling from the roof of his house. exam: distal pulses are not palpable. which vessel is damaged?,a. femoral artery,b. circumflex femoral artery,c. profundafemoris artery,d. popliteal artery,e. obturator artery,f. dorsalispedis artery,,,,,key: the key is a. femoral artery.,"Based on the examination, the vessel that is most likely damaged is the femoral artery. The femoral artery is a major vessel in the thigh that supplies blood to the lower extremities and any damage to it would result in decreased blood flow to the leg. The other choices are less likely to be damaged in this scenario as they are located further down the leg or are not as major as the femoral artery. The circumflex femoral artery and profundafemoris artery are also located in the thigh, but they are less likely to be damaged in this particular injury. The popliteal artery, obturator artery, and dorsalispedis artery are located lower down the leg and are therefore not the best options.",a,a,TRUE,
1339. a 9yo child doesn’t play with his peers and has collected 200 cars. he doesn’t respond to any criticism. what is the dx?,a. autism,b. personality disorder,c. schizophrenia,d. rett syndrome,e. social anxiety,,,,,,key: the key is a. autism.,"The correct answer is a. autism. This is because the child's behavior is consistent with the symptoms of autism, such as difficulty engaging in social interactions with peers and having a narrow range of interests. Personality disorder, schizophrenia, and Rett syndrome do not match the child's behavior, and social anxiety alone cannot explain all of the symptoms. It is important to note that this is just a possible diagnosis, as proper assessment and evaluation by a qualified professional is needed for a formal diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
1340. a 63 yo man with vague but persistent pain. on endoscopy: columnar epithelium was found to be pouched into muscularis. what is the dx?,a. adenocarcinoma,b. adenoma,c. peptic ulcer,d. h. pylori infection,,,,,,,key: the key is a. adenocarcinoma.,"The correct answer is a. adenocarcinoma. This is because the endoscopy finding of columnar epithelium pouched into the muscularis is indicative of invasive cancerous growth. Adenoma, peptic ulcer, and H. pylori infection do not typically present with this type of morphological change and are therefore not likely the cause of the patient's symptoms. Adenoma is typically a noncancerous polyp, and peptic ulcer and H. pylori infection are typically associated with inflammation and erosion of the mucosal lining rather than invasive growth into the muscular layer. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's persistent pain and endoscopic findings is adenocarcinoma.",a,a,TRUE,
"1341. a 24yo man after a head injury presents with difficulty dressing himself, difficulty in writing and inability to differentiate the fingers of his hand. which part of the brain is most likely to be affected?",a. frontal lobe,b. parietal lobe,c. temporal lobe,d. occipital lobe,e. brainstem,,,,,,"key: the key is b. parietal lobe. [dressing apraxia, agraphia and finger agnosia are features of parietal lobe lesions].","The most likely part of the brain to be affected in this 24-year-old man with difficulty dressing, writing, and finger agnosia after a head injury is the parietal lobe (answer b). This is because the parietal lobe is responsible for processing sensory information and integrating it with motor function. Dressing apraxia, agraphia, and finger agnosia are all features commonly associated with lesions in the parietal lobe. The frontal lobe (answer a) is primarily responsible for executive functions such as decision-making and planning, while the temporal lobe (answer c) is involved in auditory processing and memory. The occipital lobe (answer d) is responsible for visual processing. The brainstem (answer e) is responsible for basic functions such as breathing and heart rate, and is not typically associated with the symptoms described in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is b. parietal lobe.",b,b,TRUE,
1342. a 16yo boy in boarding school feels unwell. he developed cough and rash. his cxr showed bilateral consolidations. what is the cause of his symptoms?,a. staph aureus,b. legionella,c. mycoplasma,d. streptococcus,,,,,,,"key: the key is c. mycoplasma. [rash, bilateral consolidation favours mycoplasma pneumonia. mycoplasma is common in military barrack, prison or boarding dwellers].","The correct answer is c. Mycoplasma. This is supported by the presence of both a cough and a rash, as well as the bilateral consolidations seen on the boy's CXR, which are characteristic of mycoplasma pneumonia. Mycoplasma is also commonly found in military barracks, prisons, and boarding schools. Choices a and d, Staph Aureus and Streptococcus, respectively, are less likely causes of a pneumonia with a rash, while Choice b, Legionella, typically presents with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to respiratory symptoms, which are not present in this case. Therefore, the most likely culprit for the boy's symptoms is mycoplasma pneumonia.",c,c,TRUE,
1343. a 10yo boy is brought to the ed 10h after injury to the foot. it was punctured with a metal spike that passed through his shoe. what is the next best step?,a. ig,b. ig and vaccine,c. vaccine only,d. clean the wound,e. antibiotics,,,,,,key: the key is d. clean the wond. [“next” best step is clean the wound].,"The correct answer for this scenario is d) Clean the wound. When a 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with a foot injury caused by a metal spike that has passed through his shoe, the next best step is to immediately clean the wound. This initial step is crucial as it helps to prevent further infection and reduce the risk of tetanus. Although the administration of immunoglobulin (IG) and vaccination is also a vital step in certain cases, it is important to prioritize the cleaning of the wound first to avoid potential complications. The use of antibiotics may be necessary, but it should be reserved for cases where there is an existing infection. Thus, the correct answer in this scenario is to clean the wound first before administering any further treatments.",d,d,TRUE,
1344. a 56yo male presents with persistent watery diarrhea. what is the most likely dx?,a. treponema pallidum,b. nesseria meningitides,c. cryptosporidium,d. staph aureus,e. pseudomonas aeruginosa,,,,,,key: the key is c. cryptosporidium.,"The correct answer is c. cryptosporidium. This is because cryptosporidium is a parasite that commonly causes persistent watery diarrhea, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems. Options a, b, d, and e are either bacterial or viral pathogens that typically do not cause diarrhea, or if they do, it is not usually persistent. Therefore, they are unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is important to correctly identify the causative agent in order to prescribe the appropriate treatment and prevent further spread of infection.",c,c,TRUE,
"1345. a 2yo girl has frequency, urgency and burning micturition. she has some supra pubic tenderness. which one of the following is the most appropriate initial inv?",a. supra pubic aspiration of urine for c&s,b. clean catch of urine for c&s,c. usg,d. ivu,e. mcug,,,,,,key: the key is b. clean catch of urine for c&s. [the features are consistent with lower uti for which clean catch of urine for c&s should be done].,"In a 2-year-old girl presenting with symptoms of frequency, urgency, and burning during urination and supra pubic tenderness, the most appropriate initial investigation would be a clean catch of urine for culture and sensitivity (C&S). The features are consistent with lower urinary tract infection (UTI), for which a clean catch of urine for C&S should be performed. Supra pubic aspiration of urine for C&S (option A) is an invasive and painful procedure, hence not recommended as the initial investigation. An ultrasound (option C) may be useful in diagnosing structural abnormalities but would not confirm the presence or type of infection. Both intravenous urogram (IVU) (option D) and micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) (option E) are more invasive and carry risks of radiation exposure, and hence are not necessary as an initial investigation. Therefore, option B, a clean catch of urine for C&S, is the most appropriate initial investigation in this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,
1346. an 89yo man presents with carcinoma of posterior oropharynx. which is the single most appropriate ln involved?,a. pre-aortic ln,b. aortic ln,c. submental ln,d. submandibular ln,e. deep cervical ln,,,,,,key: the key is e. deep cervical ln.,"The correct answer is E- deep cervical lymph nodes. These nodes are located in the neck region and drain lymph from the posterior oropharynx, making them the most appropriate lymph nodes involved in this case. Option A, pre-aortic lymph nodes, are located in the anterior mediastinum and would not be involved in this scenario. Option B, aortic lymph nodes, are located in the retroperitoneum and would not be involved in this region. Option C, submental lymph nodes, drain lymph from the chin and lower lip, and option D, submandibular lymph nodes, drain lymph from the tongue, floor of mouth, and submandibular gland, both of which are not involved in the posterior oropharynx. Therefore, the correct answer is E- deep cervical lymph nodes.",e,e,TRUE,
1347. a young boy presented to the opd 12wks after renal transplantation with fever and pain in lower abdomen. renal functions were deranged. renal biopsy showed immune cell infiltrate and tubular damage. what is the most probable dx?,a. pyelonephritis,b. chronic graft rejection,c. acute rejection,d. drug toxicity,e. graft vs host disease,,,,,,"key: the key is c. acute rejection. [acute rejection usually occurs in the first few months after transplant, but may occur up to a year after transplant. features presented are typical of acute graft rejection].","The most probable diagnosis for the young boy who presented with fever, pain in lower abdomen, and deranged renal functions 12 weeks after renal transplantation along with immune cell infiltrate and tubular damage as shown in the renal biopsy is acute rejection. Acute rejection usually occurs within the first few months after transplant, but can also occur up to a year after transplant. The features presented by the young boy are typical of acute graft rejection. Pyelonephritis is an infection in the kidney which would typically present with fever and pain as well, but there would not be immune cell infiltrate and tubular damage in the renal biopsy. Chronic graft rejection occurs over a long period of time and is typically seen beyond the first year after transplantation. Drug toxicity and graft vs host disease would present with different clinical features and would not be associated with immune cell infiltrate and tubular damage in the renal biopsy. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis for the young boy is acute rejection.",c,c,TRUE,
1348. a 56yo lady presents with a pathological fx of t11 vertebra. there is found to be an underlying metastatic lesion. what is her most common primary ca?,a. lung,b. breast,c. uterine,d. brain,,,,,,,key: the key is b. breast. [in female breast and lung cancer and in male prostate and lung cancer are most common to metastasize to bone].,"In this scenario, the correct answer is b. breast. This is because breast cancer, along with lung cancer, is one of the most common types of cancer to metastasize, or spread, to the bone. Additionally, the patient's age and gender could provide additional clues; breast cancer is more common in women and typically affects individuals over the age of 50. The other choices, such as lung, uterine, and brain cancer, are less likely to spread to the bone than breast cancer. Therefore, given the patient's presentation, breast cancer is the most likely primary cancer responsible for the metastatic lesion in the T11 vertebra.",b,b,TRUE,
1349. a 6m infant has breast milk jaundice. he is otherwise feeding well and is not dehydrated. what would his lfts look like?,"a. total bilirubin:40, conjugated bilirubin<5%","b. total bilirubin:300, conjugated bilirubin 85%","c. total bilirubin:500, conjugated bilirubin>85%","d. total bilirubin:400, conjugated bilirubin<85%",,,,,,,"key: the key is a. total bilirubin:40, conjugated bilirubin<5%. [brest milk jaundice is characterized by indirect hyperbilirubinemia].","In a 6-month-old infant with breast milk jaundice, the correct answer would be a) total bilirubin: 40, conjugated bilirubin less than 5%. This is because breast milk jaundice is characterized by indirect hyperbilirubinemia, meaning that there is an increase in unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin in the blood. This increase is typically mild and does not lead to significant liver damage or conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia, which is seen in other types of jaundice. Therefore, options b), c), and d) do not fit the profile of breast milk jaundice as they show high levels of total and/or conjugated bilirubin. It is important to note that breast milk jaundice is usually a benign condition that resolves on its own and does not require treatment.",a,a,TRUE,
"1350. a 29yo man took a tour of japan and also travelled to other parts of asia, developed fever, petechie and rash on his body. he didn’t take malaria prophylaxis prior to travel. what is the most likely dx?",a. malaria,b. hsp,c. hiv,d. dengue fever,e. itp,,,,,,key: the key is d. dengue fever.,"Based on the symptoms presented by the patient, the most likely diagnosis would be dengue fever, which is caused by the dengue virus. The fever, petechiae and rash are typical symptoms of this viral infection. Although the patient didn't take malaria prophylaxis, the symptoms are not consistent with malaria. HSP (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is a vasculitis that can cause petechiae and rash, but it is not associated with fever. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) can also cause a rash, but it is unlikely to present with petechiae and fever. ITP (immune thrombocytopenia) is characterized by low blood platelets and can cause a rash, but it is not associated with fever. Therefore, dengue fever is the most likely diagnosis. It is important to confirm the diagnosis with appropriate laboratory tests and provide supportive care to manage the symptoms.",d,d,TRUE,
1351. a 4yo boy ingested his grandmother’s medicine and has developed dilated pupil. what is the cause?,a. amitryptiline,b. paracetamol,c. iron,d. digoxin,,,,,,,key: the key is a. amitryptiline. [tca causes mydriasis].,"The correct answer is A, amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant which can cause mydriasis (dilated pupils) in overdose. Paracetamol, iron, and digoxin are not known to cause mydriasis, making choices B, C, and D incorrect. It's important to note that ingestion of a grandmother's medicine by a 4-year-old child is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention from healthcare professionals.",a,a,TRUE,
1352. a 46yo male presents with confusion and drowsiness. what is the most likely dx?,a. cryptococcus neoformans,b. toxoplasma gondii,c. hsv,d. cmv,e. candida albicans,,,,,,key: the key is a. cryptococcus neoformkey: [this type of question can be regarded as cns infection in aids and some may argue there is no mention of aids. if you consider with immubnocompetent patient likely answer may be hsv and if you consider immunodeficiency likely answer is controversial! as some say toxoplasmosis as the most common and some say cryptococcus is most common].,"Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the 46-year-old male experiencing confusion and drowsiness is Cryptococcus neoformans. However, the answer is controversial as other choices like Toxoplasma gondii and HSV can be considered based on the patient's immunocompetence and immunodeficiency status. While Toxoplasma gondii is commonly associated with immunodeficiency, some say that Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common infection in AIDS patients. Also, HSV can be considered for immunocompetent patients. Therefore, the diagnosis ultimately depends on the patient's medical history and immune status.",a,a,TRUE,
1353. a child has developed rash after the tx of penicillin. what will be the cause of rash?,a. drug reaction,b. kawasaki,c. inf mono,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. drug reaction.,"The correct answer to the question is choice A, drug reaction. The child's rash is most likely a result of an allergic reaction to the penicillin medication. The immune system may recognize the medication as a foreign substance and initiate an immune response, resulting in symptoms such as a rash. Choice B, Kawasaki disease, is a separate medical condition characterized by fever, rash, and inflammation of blood vessels in the body. Choice C, infectious mononucleosis, is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and sore throat - not typically a rash. Therefore, choice A is the most appropriate explanation for the child's rash in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,
"1354. a child comes with recurrent joint pain, multiple bruises, swollen ankle and unable to move his legs. what is the inv of choice?",a. esr,b. rf,c. clotting factors,,,,,,,,key: the key is c. clotting factors. [probable diagnosis is hemarthrosis with the disease hemophilia].,"The correct answer is C, clotting factors. This is because based on the symptoms described, such as joint pain, multiple bruises, swollen ankles, and difficulty moving legs, the probable diagnosis is hemarthrosis with the disease hemophilia. Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot properly and will often result in recurrent joint bleeding. Therefore, it is crucial to check the clotting factor levels in order to confirm the diagnosis. The other options, ESR and RF, are not relevant for this specific diagnosis, as they are markers for inflammation and autoimmune diseases respectively. Therefore, the most appropriate initial investigation would be a clotting factor test in order to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of hemophilia.",c,c,TRUE,
1355. a 66yo man has renal colic. he has also presented with acute onset pain in his knee in the past. what is the single most likely cause for renal failure?,a. sle associated gn,b. hypercalcemia,c. htn,d. hyperuricemia,e. hyperoxaluria,,,,,,key: the key is d. hyperuricemia. [knee pain is due to gout and renal colic may occur from uric acid stone (urate stone)].,"Hyperuricemia is the single most likely cause for renal failure in a 66-year-old man presenting with renal colic and acute onset knee pain in the past. Renal colic is related to uric acid stones, and knee pain is a common symptom of gout. Hyperuricemia, or a high level of uric acid in the blood, can lead to the formation of urate crystals in the kidneys, causing renal failure. None of the other choices, including systemic lupus erythematosus associated glomerulonephritis, hypercalcemia, hypertension, and hyperoxaluria, have a direct correlation with the symptoms present in this case. Therefore, hyperuricemia remains the most likely cause for renal failure in this patient.",d,d,TRUE,
1356. a boy with a hx of recurrent swollen tender joints on both knees and elbows and not able to participate in sports. what is the inv of choice to dx?,a. rf/aso titre,b. clotting factor,c. esr,,,,,,,,key: the key is b. clotting factor. [haemarthrosis causing disability].,"The correct answer to the question is b) clotting factor. This is because the boy's symptoms of recurrent swollen and tender joints on both knees and elbows suggest a bleeding disorder, which can be confirmed by measuring clotting factor levels in the blood. Option a) RF/ASO titre is a test for rheumatoid arthritis and a streptococcal infection respectively, which are not relevant to the symptoms described. Option c) ESR is a non-specific test for inflammation and would not provide confirmation of a bleeding disorder. In summary, given the boy's history of recurrent joint issues, measuring clotting factor levels would be the most appropriate investigative choice to diagnose a potential bleeding disorder.",b,b,TRUE,
1357. a 26yo man is referred for gastroscopy because of a hx of several months of dyspepsia. he has routine bloods checked and is found to have a serum calcium level=3.2mmol/l with a venous bicarbonate level of 33mmol/l. renal and lft are both ormal. cxr is normal. what is the most likely cause of his hypercalcemia?,a. melanoma,b. metastatic malignancy,c. milk alkali syndrome,d. primary hyperparathyroidism,e. sarcoidosis,,,,,,"key: the key is c. milk alkali syndrome. [in medicine, milk-alkali syndrome is characterized by high blood calcium caused by taking in too much calcium and absorbable alkali; common sources of calcium and alkali are dietary supplements taken to prevent osteoporosis and antacids. if untreated, milk-alkali syndrome may lead to kidney failure or death].","The correct answer is c. milk alkali syndrome. Milk alkali syndrome is a condition where high blood calcium levels are caused by excessive intake of calcium and absorbable alkali. This syndrome is commonly seen in patients who take calcium supplements to prevent osteoporosis or antacids for acid reflux. In this case, the patient's dyspepsia could be associated with the excessive intake of antacids. Other causes of hypercalcemia, such as malignant melanoma or metastatic malignancy, are less likely due to the normal CXR and routine blood work. Primary hyperparathyroidism and sarcoidosis are also possible causes; however, in this case, the normal renal and LFT results make these less likely. Therefore, milk alkali syndrome is the most likely cause for this patient's hypercalcemia.",c,c,TRUE,
1358. a 3yo boy presents with difficulty in walking and skin lesions. what is the most likely causative agent?,a. strep pyogenes,b. rubella virus,c. parvovirus,d. papovirus,e. paramyxovirus,,,,,,key: the key is c. parvovirus. [sometimes there may occur arthropathy for which children gets difficulty to walk. there occurs macular morbiliform rash in parvovirus infection following disappearance of rash of the cheeks].,"Based on the presented symptoms, the most likely causative agent for the 3-year-old boy's condition is c. parvovirus. This virus can cause arthropathy, which can result in difficulty in walking, as well as a macular morbiliform rash following the disappearance of the characteristic rash on the cheeks. Streptococcus pyogenes, rubella virus, papovirus, and paramyxovirus are unlikely to be the cause as they do not typically present with the same symptoms as parvovirus. Therefore, the correct answer is c. parvovirus.",c,c,TRUE,
1359. a pt after his house fire came with hematemesis with erosion/ulcer of esophagus and on examination there is 55% burn and on endoscopy there is a stomach/gastric erosion and soot in the mouth. what is the tx?,a. po ppi,b. iv ppi,c. ppi and antibiotic,d. h. pylori test,e. tracheal intubation,,,,,,key: the key is e. tracheal intubation. [if a burnt patient gets soots in mouth and /or nose tracheal intubation is done. gi ulceration (here oesophageal and gastric ulcers and erosions) due tu burns are known as curlings ulcers].,"The correct answer is e. tracheal intubation. When a burnt patient presents with soot in their mouth and/or nose, tracheal intubation is necessary to protect their airway. In this case, the patient also has esophageal and gastric ulcers and erosions, known as Curling's ulcers, due to the burns. Therefore, options a, b, c, and d which involve giving a po or iv proton pump inhibitor (ppi), ppi and antibiotics, or testing for H. pylori, are not the correct choices as they only address the gastric ulcers and do not address the patient's airway protection needs. Tracheal intubation is necessary in order to protect the patient's airway and prevent further damage.",e,e,TRUE,
1360. a 40yo man complains of severe colicky loin pain that radiates to his scrotum. he is noted to have microscopic hematuria. no masses are palpated. what is the single most likely cause?,a. acute cystitis,b. bladder ca,c. renal vein thrombosis,d. acute pyelonephritis,e. ureteric calculus,,,,,,key: the key is e. ureteric calculus. [in ureteric stone there is radiation of pain from loin to groin or scrotum. there also occurs hematuria].,"The single most likely cause of a 40-year-old man complaining of severe colicky loin pain that radiates to his scrotum, with the presence of microscopic hematuria, and no masses palpated is E) ureteric calculus. The radiation of pain from the loin to the groin or scrotum and the presence of hematuria is characteristic of ureteric stones. Acute cystitis, bladder cancer, and acute pyelonephritis typically present with lower abdominal pain or flank pain, while renal vein thrombosis commonly presents with flank pain and hematuria, but without radiation of pain. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is ureteric calculus.",e,e,TRUE,
1361. a 55yo man is having slow growing ascites. when we tap the peritoneal fluid the protein is <25 and it is clear and yellow. what could be the origin for ascites?,a. budd-chiari,b. gastrinoma,c. hepatoma,d. tb,e. pancreatitis,,,,,,key: the key is a. budd-chiari syndrome. [in gastrinoma there is no ascites! in hepatoma there will be exudative ascites as in tb and pancreatitis. budd-chiary syndrome causes transudative ascites and the likely option here].,"The most likely origin of the ascites in this 55-year-old man with clear and yellow peritoneal fluid and a protein level less than 25 is Budd-Chiari syndrome (a). Hepatoma and pancreatitis are unlikely causes since they typically result in exudative ascites. Similarly, TB does not typically cause transudative ascites. Gastrinoma is not a likely cause either as it does not typically result in ascites. It is important to note that the protein level in the peritoneal fluid is an important diagnostic clue and can help differentiate between transudative and exudative ascites.",a,a,TRUE,
1362. a 7yo boy presents with his mother to gp surgery. his mother describes he had presented this since 3wks ago. he had not experienced any trauma. no other symptoms a/w the condition. exam: non tender swollen ankles bilaterally. there is no rash or lesion. he is otherwise well. which single test would be the best as an initial assessment?,a. plasma electrolytes,b. albumin,c. total serum protein,d. anti-streptolysin,,,,,,,key: the key is b. albumin. [likely cause of ankle oedema from hypoalbuminema].,"Based on the given information, the best single test for initial assessment in this case would be option B: albumin. The boy's non-tender swollen ankles suggest ankle oedema, which can be caused by various conditions such as hypoproteinaemia, liver or kidney disease, heart failure or venous insufficiency. Hypoalbuminemia, a state of low albumin levels in the blood, is a likely cause of ankle oedema in this case, given that the boy is presenting with no other symptoms a/w the condition. Albumin is synthesized by the liver and is the most abundant plasma protein that helps regulate the osmotic pressure of blood. Decreased albumin levels result in fluid accumulation in the interstitial tissues, causing oedema. Therefore, measuring albumin levels in the blood can provide useful information for diagnosing the underlying cause of ankle oedema. Plasma electrolytes and total serum protein are not specific enough for this case, and anti-streptolysin testing would be irrelevant unless the boy shows symptoms of a streptococcal infection.",b,b,TRUE,
"1363. in lyme disease, which complication is most likely to lead to collapse?",a. dilated cm,b. av block,c. mild encephalitis,d. meningitis,e. myocarditis,,,,,,key: the key is b. av block.,"The correct answer is b. AV block. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted through the bite of infected ticks. AV block, or atrioventricular block, is a condition where there is a disruption in the electrical impulses that regulate the heartbeat. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications such as dizziness, fainting, and even collapse. Dilated cm (cardiomyopathy), mild encephalitis, meningitis, and myocarditis are all potential complications of Lyme disease, but they are less likely to cause collapse than AV block. Therefore, option b is the most likely cause of collapse in patients with Lyme disease.",b,b,TRUE,
1364. a 30yo pt came to the opd with complaint of breathlessness and dry cough. he has lost 5kgs in 2m. he is an iv drug abuser. inv: cxr=bilateral interstitial shadowing. what is the single most likely causative organism?,a. klebsiella,b. tb,c. chlamydia pneumonia,d. pcp,e. chlamydia psitacci,,,,,,"key: the key is d. pcp. [iv drug abuser, weight loss, breathlessness and dry cough with interstitial shadowing indicate pcp pneumonia in an aids patient].","The correct answer for the most likely causative organism in this case is d) PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient is an IV drug abuser and has lost weight, and has presented with breathlessness, dry cough, and bilateral interstitial shadowing on the chest x-ray, all of which suggest PCP pneumonia in patients with AIDS. Therefore, the most likely causative organism in this case is PCP. Klebsiella, TB, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Chlamydia psitacci can all cause pneumonia, but they are less likely in this specific presentation and patient population.",d,d,TRUE,
1365. a 27yo female who had a rta 7m back now complaints of attacks of sudden onset rotational vertigo which comes on with sharp movements of the head and neck. which of the following would be most helpful?,a. caloric testing,b. hallpikes maneuver,c. gutenbergers test,d. meniere’s test,e. otoscopy,,,,,,key: the key is b. hallpikes maneuver. [vertigo which comes on with sharp movement of the head and neck points towards the diagnosis of benign positional vertigo which can be demonstrated by hallpikes maneuver].,"The most helpful test in this scenario would be the Hallpike's maneuver, as the patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of benign positional vertigo, which can be demonstrated by this test. Caloric testing is not useful for diagnosing this condition, and neither are the other tests listed. Otoscopy may be done to rule out any structural abnormalities, but would not provide any information on the specific cause of the vertigo.",b,b,TRUE,
1366. a man rescued from a building on fire presented with unconsciousness without any evidence of burns or external injury or soot. what would you do next?,a. 100% oxyen inhalation,b. 24% oxygen by mask,c. hyperbaric oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber,d. intubation,e. refer to specialist unit,,,,,,key: the key is a. 100% oxygen inhalation. [in co poisoning 100% oxygen is the initial management and also there is a role of hyperbaric oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber].,"The correct answer for what to do next when a man rescued from a building on fire presents with unconsciousness without any evidence of burns or external injury or soot is a. 100% oxygen inhalation. In cases of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, inhaling 100% oxygen is the initial management. This is because CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood much more tightly than oxygen, which causes the displacement of oxygen from the hemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen available to the body's tissues. Inhaling 100% oxygen helps in reversing this process by providing a high concentration of oxygen to displace the CO and increase oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. The other options such as 24% oxygen by mask, hyperbaric oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber, intubation, and referring to a specialist unit do not address the immediate concern of reversing CO poisoning. In conclusion, administering 100% oxygen inhalation is the most appropriate intervention in this situation.",a,a,TRUE,
1367. a pt has had 1 ep of depression and 2 eps of mania over the last year and now presents with depression. he is on anti-depressants. what additional pharmacological tx would now act as a prophylaxis for his condition?,a. antidepressants,b. antipsychotics,c. mood stabilizers,d. no additions req,,,,,,,key: the key is c. mood stabilizers. [antidepressant alone can lead to manic attack and to prevent this a mood stabilizer is required].,"The correct answer is C, mood stabilizers. This is because antidepressants alone can lead to a manic attack, and in order to prevent this, a mood stabilizer is required. In this specific case where the patient has had 2 episodes of mania in addition to the current episode of depression, adding an antidepressant alone would not be effective and could potentially cause harm. Antipsychotics, while they can be used to treat manic or psychotic symptoms, are not typically used as a prophylaxis for mood disorders. Therefore, the best option would be to add a mood stabilizer to the patient's current treatment plan. No additional medication is not an option, as the goal is to prevent future manic episodes.",c,c,TRUE,
1368. a man presented with a purplish swelling at the anal area. it is acutely painful and he complains of constipation for the last 2m. what is the most appropriate management?,a. i&d,b. i&d + antibiotics,c. reassure,d. analgesia,e. sclerotherapy,,,,,,key: the key is b. i&d + antibiotics. [excision is the method which is done in case of hemorrhoid not incision. this is a case of perianal hematoma which when clotted is treated by incision and left open with excellent result of healing but needs antibiotics prophylaxis from fecal contamination. it occurs in case of constipation. answer is b. incision and drainage + antibiotics. in acute case prior to thrombosis can be treated with evacuation with syringe].,"The correct answer is b. incision and drainage (I&D) plus antibiotics. The presented symptoms suggest that the man is suffering from an acute perianal hematoma, which is caused by constipation and typically results in a painful swelling in the anal region. I&D is the appropriate method for treatment of such hematoma, as it involves the incision of the clot and leaving it open to heal. Antibiotics should also be prescribed prophylactically to prevent fecal contamination. Reassurance or analgesia alone is not sufficient for the treatment of this condition. Sclerotherapy is not indicated for perianal hematoma. Evacuation with a syringe can be considered in acute cases of non-clotted hematoma, prior to thrombosis. Therefore, the most appropriate management option for this patient is b. I&D plus antibiotics.",b,b,TRUE,
"1370. a pt had a stroke. now, there is left sided weakness and right side facial numbness. ct shows ischemic stroke. which one would you prescribe?",a. alteplase,b. aspirin,c. clopidogrel,d. heparin,e. warfarin,,,,,,key: the key is a. alteplase. [some say ct detects ischaemic stroke beyond window period which is not correct and it is able to detect stroke much earlier and hence it’s place is there in the treatment with alteplase].,"The correct answer is A, alteplase. Alteplase is a thrombolytic medication that is used to dissolve blood clots that cause ischemic stroke, which is the type of stroke that is indicated by the patient's symptoms and CT scan results. Aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and warfarin are all anticoagulant medications that are not appropriate for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. These medications may actually increase the risk of bleeding complications in patients who have had a stroke. It is important to administer alteplase as soon as possible after the onset of stroke symptoms in order to maximize its effectiveness and potentially improve the patient's outcomes.",a,a,TRUE,
1371. a young boy presents with fever and cough. his father was dx with tb a week ago. the parents don’t want him to have a bal under anesthesia. which other samples can be taken for dx?,a. urine,b. blood,c. csf,d. gastric washing,e. sweat,,,,,,key: the key is d. gastric washing. [a young boy is able to cough up sputum unless it is dry cough where suspected tb is diagnosed by broncho-alveolar-lavage (bal). as in dry cough tb bacteria contaminate saliva and goes to stomach with swallowed contaminated saliva gastric-washing can bring out bacteria and detected thereby. so gastric-washing is an alternative to bal in dry cough].,"When a young boy presents with fever and cough and there is a suspicion of TB, broncho-alveolar-lavage (BAL) is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, in this case, the parents do not want their child to go through anesthesia for the procedure. In such a scenario, gastric washing is an alternative to BAL for diagnosis in cases of dry cough because the bacteria can contaminate the saliva and be detected through gastric washing. Therefore, the correct answer is d. Urine and blood tests do not confirm TB. CSF testing is not relevant in this case, and sweat testing is usually done for cystic fibrosis.",d,d,TRUE,
"1372. a 50yo man came to the hosp a few months after he had a mi. exam: everything normal, s1 and s2 were heard on auscultation, but there is a new pan-sytolic murmur. what is the most appropriate inv of choice?",a. ecg,b. 24h ecg,c. echo,d. cxr,e. ct,,,,,,key: the key is c. echo. [to rule out any valvular lesion (following papillary muscle rupture) or septal lesion].,"The most appropriate investigation of choice for a 50-year-old man who came to the hospital a few months after having a myocardial infarction with a new pan-systolic murmur is an echocardiogram (choice c). An echocardiogram is essential to determine if there are any associated valvular or septal lesions that could have resulted from papillary muscle rupture or any other post-MI complication. An electrocardiogram (choice a) and 24-hour electrocardiogram (choice b) may not provide a clear diagnosis regarding the source of the murmur. Similarly, a chest x-ray (choice d) and a computed tomography (choice e) are not the most appropriate investigations for evaluating a new pan-systolic murmur. Therefore, an echocardiogram is the most appropriate and effective investigation to provide a definitive diagnosis and guide the appropriate treatment plan.",c,c,TRUE,
1373. a 73yo stroke pt has been on aspirin for 2yrs. he now presents with epigastric pain and is asking for a tx. what is the most appropriate management?,a. laparotomy,b. nsaids,c. omeprazole,d. morphine,e. tramadol,,,,,,key: the key is c. omeprazole.,"The correct answer is c. Omeprazole. The patient's symptoms suggest that the aspirin has caused damage to the stomach lining, resulting in gastritis. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces the amount of acid produced in the stomach and helps to heal the damaged lining. Laparotomy would be an invasive and unnecessary procedure in this case. NSAIDs could worsen the patient's symptoms and should be avoided. Morphine and tramadol are not indicated for the management of gastritis.",c,c,TRUE,
1374. a 2yo girl is brought to the ed by her mother. the child is screaming that there is something in her ear and she appears agitated. exam: a plastic bead is seen inside the ear. what is the best method of removal?,a. forceps,b. hook,c. under general anesthesia,d. syringing,e. magnet,,,,,,key: the key is c. under general anaesthesia.,"The correct answer is C, to remove the plastic bead from the ear, the best method is to perform the procedure under general anesthesia. This is because attempting to remove the bead with forceps, hook, or syringing could cause further damage to the child's ear, leading to possible complications such as infections or hearing loss. The use of a magnet may not be effective if the bead is not magnetic, so it is also not recommended. General anesthesia provides the child with complete sedation, making it easier for the physician to safely and quickly remove the foreign body without causing any harm to the child. It is important to note that in cases of foreign body removal from a child's ear, it is always best to seek immediate medical attention from a qualified healthcare provider.",c,c,TRUE,
"1375. during antenatal visits, the following tests are routinely offered to all pregnant mothers apart from hiv and hep b?",a. rubella and syphilis,b. syphilis and toxoplasmosis,c. hep c & thalassemia,d. cmv and rubella,e. sickle cell anemia and hep,,,,,,key: the key is a. rubella and syphilis.,"During antenatal visits, pregnant mothers are routinely offered tests for rubella and syphilis in addition to HIV and Hep B. The reason for this is that rubella and syphilis can both lead to serious adverse outcomes for the developing fetus if left undiagnosed and untreated. Rubella can cause congenital rubella syndrome, which can result in deafness, blindness, heart disease, and cognitive impairments. Similarly, syphilis can lead to stillbirth, premature birth, or congenital syphilis, which can cause serious neurologic, skeletal, and cardiac abnormalities. The other answer choices (b, c, d, and e) are not routinely tested for during antenatal visits, as they are either less common or are not typically associated with adverse outcomes for the developing fetus. Therefore, the correct answer is A, rubella and syphilis, as these tests are crucial for identifying and treating potential risks to the health of the mother and her developing baby.",a,a,TRUE,
1376. a 32yo male complains of tremors everytime he tends to use his muscles and when he is pointing at objects. no complaints at rest. his father complained of similar problems. what is the most probable dx?,a. parkinsonism,b. lithium toxicity,c. thyrotoxicosis,d. benign essential tremor,,,,,,,key: the key is d. benign essential tremor. [in benign essential tremor there is no rest tremor but tremor occurs during movement of the affected limb].,"Based on the presenting symptoms and family history of the patient, the most probable diagnosis would be d. benign essential tremor. This condition is characterized by tremors that occur during movement of the affected limb, such as when the patient tends to use his muscles and when he is pointing at objects, but not at rest. Parkinsonism, option a, is characterized by a resting tremor, which is not present in this case. Lithium toxicity, option b, can cause tremors but is less likely given the patient's age and lack of reported lithium use. Thyrotoxicosis, option c, can also cause tremors but is less likely given the absence of other typical symptoms associated with this condition. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis is benign essential tremor.",d,d,TRUE,
1377. a 40yo woman with breast cancer has back pain which keep her awake at night. she blames it on a gym session she had 2wks ago. she now has difficulty in climbing stairs. there is tenderness over the right thoracic spine. she has diminished fine touch and temp sensation in her right foot. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. bone density scan,b. ct head,c. mri spine,d. nuclear bone scan,e. xr thoracolumbar spine,,,,,,key: the key is c. mri spine. [there is neurological deficit so to exclude spinal involvement mri is the single most appropriate investigation].,"The single most appropriate investigation in this scenario is a MRI spine. This is because the patient is exhibiting neurological deficit, which may indicate spinal involvement. CT head, bone density scan, nuclear bone scan, and XR thoracolumbar spine would not provide the necessary information to diagnose spinal involvement. Thus, these options are incorrect. MRI spine is the best choice as it can provide information on any structural abnormality that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Therefore, it is important to conduct this investigation to identify and address the cause of the patient's back pain and neurological deficit.",c,c,TRUE,
"1378. a pregnant lady at her 39wk ga present with eclampsia. soon after her arrival in the labour suit, iv mgso4 and iv hydralazine has been prescribed. the pt then develops another fit in the hosp and maintenance dose of mgso4 has been started. what is your next step in management?",a. mg so4 bolus,b. delivery of baby,c. mgso4 loading dose,d. diazepam,,,,,,,key: the key is a. mgso4 bolus.,"The correct answer to this question is a. mgso4 bolus. Eclampsia is a serious condition that can cause seizures during pregnancy. The immediate management includes administering IV magnesium sulfate (mgso4) to control seizures. In this case, since the patient has already been prescribed the maintenance dose of mgso4, the next step in management should be to administer a bolus of mgso4 to control the current fit. Delivery of the baby may also be considered as a treatment option, but it can be risky without controlling the seizures first. The loading dose of mgso4 is typically given at the initial management stage, and diazepam is not recommended for the treatment of eclampsia. Therefore, the correct option is a. mgso4 bolus to effectively control the current fit and prevent any further complications.",a,a,TRUE,
1379. a man suffering from influenza a since 5d ago. cxr: pneumonia. what organism is responsible for pneumonia in this pt?,a. hemophilius influenze,b. klebsiella,c. staphylococcus aureus,d. streptococcus pneumonia,e. pseudomonas,,,,,,key: the key is c. staphylococcus aureus. [post flue pneumonia is usually caused by staphylococcus aureus].,"The correct answer is C, Staphylococcus aureus. Post-flu pneumonia is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common bacteria found on the skin and nasal passages of healthy individuals but can cause infections when it enters the bloodstream or lungs. This bacteria is known to cause severe and sometimes life-threatening pneumonia in people who have weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions. The other choices are not likely to be responsible for pneumonia after influenza A infection. Hemophilus influenzae can sometimes cause pneumonia but is less common in adults. Klebsiella is more commonly associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia and tends to affect older individuals with underlying lung problems. Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause bacterial pneumonia, but it is typically seen as a complication of community-acquired infections in children and older adults. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections, but it is not frequently associated with post-flu pneumonia.",c,c,TRUE,
1380. a pt admitted due to repeated attacks of pancreatitis presents with dementia and loss of proprioception in the legs. what is the most appropriate tx?,a. thiamine,b. pyridoxine,c. cobolamin,d. lipase,e. antibiotics,,,,,,key: the key is c. cobalamin. [pancreatic insufficiency can lead to malabsorption and b12 (cobalamin) deficiency. dementia and diminished vibratory sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common objective findings of cobalamin deficiency].,"The correct answer is c. cobalamin. In this case, the patient's repeated attacks of pancreatitis have led to pancreatic insufficiency, which can result in malabsorption and a deficiency in vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin. The patient's symptoms of dementia and loss of proprioception in the legs are commonly associated with cobalamin deficiency. Therefore, providing the patient with cobalamin supplementation would be the most appropriate treatment option. Thiamine (a), pyridoxine (b), and lipase (d) are not relevant to treating cobalamin deficiency, while antibiotics (e) would not be effective in treating the neurological symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
1381. a man after mi presented with sudden breathlessness and dyspnea. exam: scattered pansystolic murmur all over the precordium. what is the next inv that will lead to dx?,a. ecg,b. echo,c. ct,d. blood culture,e. cxr,,,,,,key: the key is b. echo. [sudden breathlessness and dyspnea suggest mitral regurgitation secondary to papillary muscle rupture but on the otherhand pansystolic murmur all over the precordium suggest vsd! however in either case required investigation is echo].,"The correct answer for the next investigation to diagnose the cause of sudden breathlessness and dyspnea in a man after MI with a scattered pansystolic murmur all over the precordium is B. Echo. An echo can identify whether there is a papillary muscle rupture causing mitral regurgitation or a VSD, both of which can cause the symptoms and murmur described. An ECG may show changes consistent with a recent MI but cannot diagnose the underlying cause of the symptoms. CT and CXR do not provide enough information related to cardiac function or structure to diagnose mitral regurgitation or VSD. Blood culture is not helpful in identifying the cardiac cause of the symptoms. Therefore, echo is the most appropriate investigation to lead to a diagnosis and guide further management.",b,b,TRUE,
"1382. during a laparoscopic procedure, a trochar is inserted halfway between the umbilicus and the ant superior iliac spine. what are the structures most likely to be pierced?",a. rectus sheath,b. linea alba,c. external oblique aponeurosis,d. internal oblique and transverse abdominal,e. both c and d,,,,,,key: the key is d. internal oblique and transversus abdominis.,"The correct answer is D - internal oblique and transversus abdominis. This is because these muscles lie immediately deep to the external oblique aponeurosis, which is pierced when the trochar is inserted. The rectus sheath and linea alba are more medial structures and are less likely to be pierced during this procedure. Option E combines the correct answer with an incorrect option, making it an invalid choice. Therefore, option D is the most likely and accurate answer for this question.",d,d,TRUE,
"1383. a pt, a small child presented with urti and later developed fever, earache and tympanic membrane is dull. what is the likely dx?",a. om,b. oe,c. glue ear,d. perforation of the tympanic membrane,e. referred ear ache,,,,,,"key: the key is a. om. [fever, earache and dull tympanic membrane following urti are pointing the diagnosis of acute otitis media].","The correct answer to this question is a) acute otitis media (OM). The presence of fever, earache, and a dull tympanic membrane following a upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is indicative of acute OM. Option b) outer ear infection (OE) typically presents with ear pain, discharge, and itching of the ear canal, but does not involve the middle ear. Option c) glue ear, or otitis media with effusion, usually presents with hearing loss and fluid behind the eardrum, but typically does not cause fever or earache. Option d) perforation of the tympanic membrane can occur as a complication of OM, but is not a likely initial diagnosis. Option e) referred earache refers to ear pain that stems from a problem in another location in the body, such as the teeth or jaw, and is not the likely cause of the symptoms described. Therefore, a) acute OM is the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and presentation of the patient.",a,a,TRUE,
1384. a 72yo male who is a regular smoker has come to the ed with complaints of loss of weight and loss of appetite. he also complains of odynophagia. exam: actively bleeding ulcer on right tonsil. what is the most appropriate dx?,a. tonsillar ca,b. vincent’s angina,c. irritant ingestion,d. paracoccidiodmycosis,e. herpes simplex infection,,,,,,key: the key is a. tonsillar ca.,"The correct answer is a, tonsillar cancer. This patient's symptoms of weight loss, loss of appetite, and odynophagia along with the presence of an actively bleeding ulcer on the right tonsil are highly suggestive of tonsillar cancer. This is especially concerning given the patient's age and history of smoking, which are both significant risk factors for developing head and neck cancers. Vincent's angina, irritant ingestion, paracoccidioidomycosis, and herpes simplex infection are unlikely given the patient's presentation and exam findings. Vincent's angina is a bacterial infection of the tonsils and usually presents with severe sore throat and swollen tonsils without ulceration. Irritant ingestion would not explain the presence of an ulcer on the tonsil. Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that primarily affects the lungs and would not explain the ulcer or other symptoms. Herpes simplex infection typically presents with painful blisters or sores on the lips or genital area, and would not explain the ulcer on the tonsil. Thus, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is tonsillar cancer, and further evaluation and treatment are warranted.",a,a,TRUE,
"1385. a pt with regular episodes of snhl, vertigo and tinnitus lasting >30min. neurological exam=normal. what is the likely dx?",a. meniere’s disease,b. acoustic neuroma,c. otosclerosis,d. benign positional vertigo,e. labrynthitis,,,,,,"key: the key is a. meniere’s disease. [snhl vertigo andtinnitus lasting 30 minutes are consistent with meniers disease. here attacks are episodic that is symptoms resolves but hearing loss is progressive. in acoustic neuroma hearing loss is not episodic. otosclerosis also not episodic and conductive type. benign positional vertigo, no hearing loss and vertigo with sharp posture change. unilateral loss of vestibular function and hearing associated with nausea and vomiting which is preceded by viral infection].","Based on the symptoms described, the likely diagnosis for the patient is Meniere's disease. Meniere's disease is characterized by episodes of sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus lasting more than 30 minutes. The attacks are usually episodic but hearing loss is progressive. The other options in the answer choices can be ruled out as they do not fit the patient's symptoms. Acoustic neuroma does not present with episodic hearing loss, while otosclerosis is a conductive hearing loss and is not episodic. Benign positional vertigo does not cause hearing loss, and labyrinthitis is usually accompanied by nausea and vomiting preceded by a viral infection. Therefore, Meniere's disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.",a,a,TRUE,
"1386. a pt with celiac disease from birth, now as an adult presented with some abdominal symptoms. the biopsy shows infiltration of the gastric epithelium by lymphocytes. what is the most likely dx?",a. lymphoma,b. diverticular disease,c. lynch syndrome,d. gastric tb,e. peritoneal tumor,,,,,,key: the key is a. lymphoma. [coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of gut].,"The correct answer is A, lymphoma. Patients with coeliac disease are at an increased risk of developing both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the gut. In this case, the biopsy showed infiltration of the gastric epithelium by lymphocytes, indicating a lymphoma. Diverticular disease is not associated with coeliac disease and does not present with gastric epithelial infiltration. Lynch syndrome is a hereditary condition that increases the risk of certain cancers, but not specifically lymphoma. Gastric TB presents with granulomatous inflammation, not lymphocytic infiltration. Peritoneal tumor is not related to coeliac disease and would present with different symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is lymphoma.",a,a,TRUE,
"1387. a 55yo man presented with hot, raised, tender area of skin on his right leg. he is febrile with rigors. he has been started on flucloxacillin. what other meds will you add?",a. ciprofloxacin,b. gentamicin,c. metronidazole,d. benzylpenicillin,e. ceftriaxone,,,,,,"key: the key is d. benzylpenicillin. [abscess, cellulitis, furuncle these lesions are usually caused by staphylococcus and streptococcus. so benzylpenicillin should be added with flucloxacillin to cover streptococcus].","In this case, the correct answer would be d. benzylpenicillin. As the patient presented with symptoms of abscess, cellulitis, or furuncle, it is likely that the lesions are caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria. Flucloxacillin is effective against Staphylococcus, but adding benzylpenicillin will cover both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Therefore, it is important to add benzylpenicillin to the treatment plan. The other choices are not suitable for this particular case. Ciprofloxacin is not effective against Streptococcus, and gentamicin does not cover either Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. Metronidazole is used for anaerobic bacteria and is not indicated in this case. Finally, ceftriaxone is not effective against Staphylococcus and does not have the necessary coverage for this particular scenario.",d,d,TRUE,
1388. a 65yo man has incurable bronchial cancer. he is unable to cough up his secretions. this is leading to a distressing cough. which of the following drugs is most likely to help him?,a. scopolamine,b. xanomeline,c. aceclidine,d. pilocarpine,e. cevimiline,,,,,,key: the key is a. scopolamine. [any secretory condition of lung is reduced and improved with scopolamine].,"The correct answer to the question is a) scopolamine. Scopolamine can help alleviate the symptoms of a distressing cough in a patient with incurable bronchial cancer, by reducing any secretory conditions of the lung. Xanomeline, aceclidine, pilocarpine, and cevimeline are unlikely to be effective in treating this particular condition. Xanomeline is a muscarinic agonist and has been studied for its potential use in treating Alzheimer's disease. Aceclidine is another muscarinic agonist that can be used to treat Sjogren's syndrome, a condition that causes dry eyes and dry mouth. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are both used to treat dry mouth caused by Sjogren's syndrome or as a side effect of certain medications like chemotherapy. Therefore, the most appropriate drug in this scenario would be scopolamine.",a,a,TRUE,
1389. a pt presented after eating a seafood dish at a local restaurant. he complains of difficulty in breathing. his speech is slurred and his bp=85/55mmhg. what would be the most appropriate next step?,a. iv adrenaline,b. im adrenaline,c. sc adrenaline,d. po chlorpheniramine,e. iv chlorpheniramin,,,,,,key: the key is b. im adrenaline. [patient is getting anaphylactic shock with difficulty of breathing and slurred speech (probably from tongue swelling) which is indications of im adrenaline].,"The correct answer for this question is b. im adrenaline. The patient is experiencing anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening. The symptoms of difficulty in breathing, slurred speech, and low blood pressure indicate an urgent need for immediate treatment. IV adrenaline may be the first choice for treatment, but IV access may not be immediately available, so IM adrenaline is the next best option as it can be administered quickly and easily. SC adrenaline may take longer to take effect and is not recommended for severe cases. PO chlorpheniramine may not be effective enough and should not be used as the first-line treatment. IV chlorpheniramine may also take longer to take effect and is not a recommended option for immediate treatment of anaphylactic shock. Therefore, the best course of action for this patient would be to administer IM adrenaline.",b,b,TRUE,
1390. a 7yo boy presents with proptosis and periorbital edema. what is the immediate action that needs to be taken?,a. iv morphine and immediate ophthalmoscopy,b. iv morphine,c. observation only,,,,,,,,key: the key is a. iv morphine and immediate ophthalmoscopy.,"In response to a 7-year-old boy presenting with proptosis and periorbital edema, the immediate action that needs to be taken is option A, which involves administering IV morphine and conducting an immediate ophthalmoscopy. The IV morphine will help to alleviate any pain or discomfort the boy is experiencing, while the ophthalmoscopy allows for thorough examination and assessment of the affected eye. Option B, which only involves administering IV morphine, is not sufficient because it fails to address the need for Ophthalmic Assessment. Additionally, option C, observation only, is not a viable option as it fails to address the possibility of serious underlying conditions that require immediate attention. Therefore, option A is the correct answer due to the urgency of the situation and the need for immediate action.",a,a,TRUE,
1391. a schizophrenic man complains that he can hear voices talking about him and telling him to end his life by cutting his throat. he only hears them when he wakes up from sleep and not at other times. what type of hallucinations is he having?,a. somatic,b. kinesthetic,c. hypnogogic,d. hypnopompic,e. lilliputian,,,,,,key: the key is d. hypnapompic hallucination. [hallucinations during going for sleep is hypnagogic and hallucinations during wake up from sleep is hypnapompic hallucinations].,"The correct answer to the question is d. Hypnapompic hallucinations. These are hallucinations that occur during the waking transition from sleep, just as the man in the question is experiencing. Somatic and kinesthetic hallucinations involve a false perception of bodily sensations and movement, respectively, and are not relevant in this case. Hypnogogic hallucinations occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep and would not explain the man's experience of hearing the voices only upon waking. Lilliputian hallucinations involve a perception of objects as smaller than reality and are not relevant to this case either. Therefore, the correct answer is d, as the man is experiencing hallucinations during the hypnapompic state.",d,d,TRUE,
1392. a 28yo woman complains of hearing strange voices in her bedroom as she is falling asleep in the night. she says there is no one in the room except her. on evaluation she has no other problems. what is she suffering from?,a. delusion of persecution,b. cotard syndrome,c. hypnogogic hallucinations,d. lilliputian hallucinations,e. schizophrenia,,,,,,key: the key is c. hypnagogic hallucinations. [hallucinations during going for sleep is hypnagogic and hallucinations during wake up from sleep is hypnapompic hallucinations].,"The correct answer is c. hypnagogic hallucinations. This is when someone experiences hallucinations during the transition between wakefulness and sleep, such as falling asleep or waking up. The woman in this case is hearing strange voices as she is falling asleep, which is characteristic of hypnagogic hallucinations. The other choices are not the best answer because delusion of persecution refers to the belief that one is being persecuted or harassed, whereas the woman in this case is experiencing auditory hallucinations. Cotard syndrome is a rare condition where someone believes they are dead or do not exist, which again does not fit with the woman's symptoms. Lilliputian hallucinations are where things look smaller than they actually are, which is not relevant to the woman's case. Lastly, schizophrenia is a serious mental illness characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and disordered thinking, which the woman in this case does not exhibit.",c,c,TRUE,
1393. a 32yo man on psychiatric meds presents with coarse tremors and diarrhea. what is the most likely alt to the drug causing the prb?,a. lithium,b. diazepam,c. haloperidol,d. valproate,e. citalopram,,,,,,key: the key is d. valproate. [diarrhea and coarse tremors are well known side effects of valproate].,"The most likely alternative for the drug causing the patient's coarse tremors and diarrhea is lithium, diazepam, haloperidol, or citalopram, as these drugs can also cause similar side effects. However, based on the given information, the correct answer is d. valproate, as diarrhea and coarse tremors are well-known side effects of this drug. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are likely caused by the valproate medication. Therefore, the other answer choices are incorrect because they do not provide a more likely alternative to the drug causing the problem.",d,d,TRUE,
"1394. a man is brought to the ed after he was stabbed in the chest. chest is clear bilaterally with muffled heart sounds. bp=60/0mmhg, pulse=120bpm, jvp is raised. what is the most probable dx?",a. pulmonary embolism,b. cardiac tamponade,c. pericardial effusion,d. hemothorax,e. pneumothorax,,,,,,key: the key is b. cardiac tamponade. [lungs clear bilaterally excludes effusion and pneumothorax. muffled heart sound and low bp with raised jvp points towards the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade].,"Based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis for the man brought to the ED after being stabbed in the chest is cardiac tamponade (option b). The presence of muffled heart sounds and low blood pressure, combined with a raised JVP, suggests the presence of fluid or blood around the heart. This is a medical emergency that requires urgent treatment, such as pericardiocentesis, to relieve the pressure on the heart and allow it to function properly. Pulmonary embolism (option a) involves a blood clot in the lung, which can cause respiratory distress, but does not typically present with muffled heart sounds or a low blood pressure. Pericardial effusion (option c) is a buildup of fluid in the sac surrounding the heart, which can also lead to symptoms similar to cardiac tamponade, but not as severe. Hemothorax (option d) would involve blood in the chest cavity and may present with breathlessness and chest pain, but would not explain the muffled heart sounds and raised JVP. Pneumothorax (option e) is a collapsed lung, which would not explain the muffled heart sounds, low blood pressure, or raised JVP. Therefore, option b, cardiac tamponade, is the most likely diagnosis given the symptom presentation in this scenario.",b,b,TRUE,
1395. a 64yo alcoholic who has been dx with liver cirrhosis presents with a massive ascites. what is the mechanism of fluid accumulation in a pt with liver disease?,a. cirrhosis,b. portal htn,c. hypoalbuminemia,d. liver failure,e. hepatic encephalopathy,,,,,,"key: the key is c. hypoalbuminemia. [mechanism of fluid accumulation (in general, not only ascites) is hypoalbuminaemia].","The correct answer is c. Hypoalbuminemia. When a patient with liver disease experiences hypoalbuminemia, there is a decrease in the level of albumin in the blood which results in a decrease of the oncotic pressure in the blood vessels. This leads to fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces, including the abdominal cavity, which can result in ascites. While cirrhosis and portal hypertension can also lead to ascites, they do not explain the mechanism of fluid accumulation. Liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy are not directly related to the development of ascites. Therefore, hypoalbuminemia is the most likely mechanism for fluid accumulation in a patient with liver disease.",c,c,TRUE,
1396. a 38yo man presented to ed with severe pain in upper abdomen. he has already taken course of triple therapy and now had elective endoscopy 2d ago. he is in shock. what is the most probable dx?,a. ca esophagus,b. barret’s esophagus,c. mediastinitis,d. ca stomach,,,,,,,key: the key is c. mediastinitis.,"The correct answer is c. mediastinitis. This is because a 38-year-old man presenting with severe pain in the upper abdomen, who has already undergone a course of triple therapy and had an elective endoscopy 2 days prior, could have developed mediastinitis as a complication following the endoscopy. Mediastinitis is a rare but serious condition that occurs when the tissue in the middle of the chest becomes inflamed or infected. The symptoms can include severe chest pain, fever, and shock. The other answer choices, such as ca esophagus, barret's esophagus, and ca stomach, are less probable given the patient's presenting symptoms and history. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of mediastinitis and seek medical attention promptly, as this condition can be life-threatening if left untreated.",c,c,TRUE,
1397. a 68yo man who is a known case of liver cirrhosis has developed ascites. what is the mechanism for the development of ascites?,a. portal htn,b. hypoalbuminemia,c. congestive heart failure,d. liver failure,,,,,,,key: the key is a. portal hypertension. [in liver cirrhosis ascites (not generalized oedema which is caused by hypoalbuminemia and other mechanisms) is caused by portal hypertension (portal hypertension is invariable in cirrhosis) along with other factors].,"The correct answer is a. portal hypertension. Ascites in liver cirrhosis is caused by portal hypertension, which is a common and invariable complication of cirrhosis. This occurs due to a decrease in liver function and an increase in resistance to blood flow through the liver, causing an increase in pressure in the portal vein. This increased pressure causes fluid to leak from blood vessels into the abdominal cavity, resulting in the accumulation of fluid and the development of ascites. While hypoalbuminemia and other mechanisms may lead to generalized edema, they do not specifically cause ascites in cirrhosis. Congestive heart failure and liver failure are not the primary mechanisms for the development of ascites in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
1398. a man feels mild discomfort in the anal region and purulent discharge in underpants. what is the most likely dx?,a. feacal incontinence,b. anal abscess,c. fistula in ano,d. anal tags,e. rectal ca,,,,,,key: the key is c. fistula in ano. [abscess is with severe pain which may reduce after it bursts with purulent discharge. but here mild discomfort and purulent discharge favours the diagnosis of fistula].,"The most likely diagnosis for a man experiencing mild discomfort in the anal region and purulent discharge in his underpants is c. Fistula in ano. While anal abscess can also present with purulent discharge, typically it is accompanied by severe pain which may reduce after it bursts. In this case, the mild discomfort and purulent discharge are more suggestive of a fistula. Faecal incontinence, anal tags, and rectal cancer are not consistent with the symptoms described and are unlikely diagnoses. Therefore, fistula in ano is the correct answer.",c,c,TRUE,
1399. a 38yo female presents with difficult in looking upward and on examination she was found to have lid lag as well. she also complains of her heart racing at times. which test will help in dx?,a. tensilon test,b. 24h ecg,c. tft,d. schimmer test,e. young helmholtz ophthalmoscopy,,,,,,key: the key is c. tft. [difficulty in looking upwards is due to superior rectus or inferior oblique palsy and palsy of one or more extra-ocular muscle can occur in thyrotoxicosis which is known as ballett’s sign. there is lid lag in thyrotoxicosis and racing heart is due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation caused by hyperthyroidism].,"The correct answer is c. TFT, which stands for thyroid function test. The patient's difficulty in looking upwards and lid lag suggest a palsy of the superior rectus or inferior oblique muscles, which can occur in thyrotoxicosis (an overactive thyroid gland). The racing heart is likely due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation caused by hyperthyroidism. The other options (a, b, d, e) are not relevant to the patient's presentation and would not aid in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. The tensilon test is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder, and the Schirmer test measures tear production. Young-Helmholtz ophthalmoscopy is not a diagnostic tool. A 24-hour ECG may be used to diagnose heart rhythm abnormalities, but it would not identify the underlying cause of the racing heart. Overall, the combination of difficulty looking upwards, lid lag, and racing heart strongly suggests thyrotoxicosis, making TFT the most appropriate test for diagnosis.",c,c,TRUE,
1400. a young anxious mother of a 10m boy comes to you and requests a test for cf. what is the most appropriate inv?,a. sweat test,b. heel prick test,c. breath test,d. cxr,,,,,,,"key: the key is a. sweat test. [the sweat test measures the concentration of chloride that is excreted in sweat. it is used to screen for cystic fibrosis (cf). due to defective chloride channels, the concentration of chloride in sweat is elevated in individuals with cystic fibrosis].","The most appropriate investigative test for cystic fibrosis (CF) in a young anxious mother's 10-month-old boy is the sweat test. This test measures the amount of chloride that is excreted in sweat by the individual and is used to screen for CF. In individuals with CF, the concentration of chloride in sweat is typically elevated due to defective chloride channels. The heel prick test and breath test are not appropriate investigations for CF as they measure other aspects of health such as blood sugar and lung function. CXR, or chest x-ray, is also not an appropriate test as it does not screen for CF. Therefore, the correct answer is A, the sweat test, as it is the most appropriate investigative test for CF screening in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
1401. a 22yo greek man presents with rapid anemia and jaundice following tx of malaria. he is noted to have heinx bodies. choose the single most likely cause from the given options?,a. g6pd deficiency,b. anemia of chronic disease,c. pernicious anemia,d. ida,e. vit b12 deficiency,,,,,,"key: the key is a. g6pd deficiency. [g6pd (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency exacerbated by administration of oxidant drugs (e.g., primaquine, dapsone, quinidine) can also result in heinz bodies].","The most likely cause of the rapid anemia and jaundice in the 22-year-old Greek man who was treated for malaria and has Heinz bodies is G6PD deficiency. Oxidant drugs such as primaquine, dapsone, and quinidine can exacerbate the deficiency leading to the formation of Heinz bodies. Anemia of chronic disease, pernicious anemia, IDA, and vitamin B12 deficiency are not likely to cause Heinz body formation, making option A the most appropriate answer.",a,a,TRUE,
1402. a 65yo has terminal cancer and his pain is relieved by a fentanyl patch but he now complains of shooting pain in his arm. which of the following will add to his pain relief?,a. gabapentin,b. radiotherapy,c. amitryptiline,d. morphine,,,,,,,key: the key is a. gabapentin. [shooting in the arm indicates neuropathic pain for which both amytriptiline and gabapentin can be used].,"In this scenario, the correct answer is a. gabapentin, as shooting pain in the arm indicates neuropathic pain for which both amytriptiline and gabapentin can be used. The reason why radiotherapy and morphine are not the correct choices is because radiotherapy is used for localized cancer pain and morphine is already being used and has reached its maximum effective dose for the patient. Gabapentin works by reducing the sensitivity of nerves and is often used to treat neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline is also a valid choice, but gabapentin is preferred as it has fewer side effects and a lower risk for overdose compared to amytriptiline. Therefore, adding gabapentin to the patient's medication regimen can provide additional pain relief for their shooting arm pain.",a,a,TRUE,

[spider nevi and ascites suggest advanced liver disease. here in alcoholic middle aged man having large hematemesis with above mentioned features are very suggestive of bleeding from esophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis].,"Based on the given information, the correct answer is d. esophageal varices. The presence of spider nevi and ascites suggest advanced liver disease, which is commonly caused by excessive alcohol consumption. The large hematemesis also indicates severe bleeding, which is commonly caused by ruptured esophageal varices. This is a complication of portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis, which occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and increases pressure in the portal vein. Gastric cancer (a) and esophageal cancer (c) are unlikely given the patient's history of alcoholism and the presence of other symptoms indicating advanced liver disease. Mallory-Weiss tear (b), esophagitis (e), and peptic ulceration (f) may cause bleeding but are less likely given the presence of spider nevi and ascites.",d,d,TRUE,

[this is fibroadenoma of the breast (breast mouse) for which us of breast is the appropriate investigation and if it reveal a fibrous lump we shall go for fnac. another point a doctor should know that for any suspicious breast lesion radiology should must be done before options of biopsy and investigation of choice in radiology is us scan before the age of 35 and mammography after the age of 35. in that term also for this case the investigation of choice is us breast].,"The most appropriate investigation for this 23-year-old woman with a small smooth, firm, mobile mass in her left breast is b. US breast. This is because she is under the age of 35, and the investigation of choice for suspicious breast lesions in this age group is US scan. If the US scan reveals a fibrous lump, then we shall go for FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology). Mammography is not recommended for women under 35 years of age as their breast tissue is dense, making it difficult to detect lumps. Therefore, option a is incorrect. Option c, FNAC, is a possible investigation if the US scan reveals a fibrous lump. Option d, mammography and US, is incorrect because mammography is not recommended for women under 35 years of age, as mentioned earlier. It is important for doctors to know the appropriate investigations for suspicious breast lesions to ensure accurate diagnosis and management.",b,b,TRUE,
"1405. a pt was admitted with abdominal pain, diarrhea, pigmented palmar creases and buccal mucosa. what is the most probable dx?",a. addison’s disease,b. cushing syndrome,c. pheochromocytoma,d. hyperthyroidism,e. hypoparathyroidism,,,,,,"key: the key is a. addison’s disease. [abdominal pain, diarrhea, pigmented palmar creases and buccal mucosa are well known features of addisons disease].","Based on the presented symptoms, the most probable diagnosis is Addison's disease (answer choice A). Addison's disease is a condition in which the adrenal glands fail to produce enough cortisol and aldosterone. Typical symptoms of Addison's disease include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hyperpigmentation of the skin, especially in creases such as the palmar creases and buccal mucosa. Cushing syndrome (answer choice B) is characterized by excessive cortisol production, leading to weight gain and muscle weakness among other symptoms. Pheochromocytoma (answer choice C) is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that leads to excessive adrenaline production and symptoms such as high blood pressure and rapid heartbeat. Hyperthyroidism (answer choice D) is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much hormone, leading to symptoms such as weight loss and rapid heartbeat. Hypoparathyroidism (answer choice E) occurs when the parathyroid gland does not produce enough hormone, leading to low calcium levels and symptoms such as muscle cramps and tingling sensations. While some of the presented symptoms may overlap with these conditions, Addison's disease is the best diagnosis based on the combination of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hyperpigmentation in creases.",a,a,TRUE,
"1406. a 36yo pt came with diarrhea, bleeding, weight loss and fistula. what is the single most likely dx?",a. colorectal ca,b. celiac disease,c. cd,d. uc,e. ibs,,,,,,key: the key is c. cd. [bloody diarrhea can occur in both cd & uc. also weight loss is common! but fistula formation is unique feature of cd].,"Based on the given symptoms, the single most likely diagnosis for the 36-year-old patient is Crohn's disease (CD) (option c). CD is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that commonly presents with symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and fistula formation. Although colorectal cancer (option a) can also present with similar symptoms, it is less likely in a 36-year-old patient given their age. Celiac disease (option b) mainly presents with gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, but not with fistula formation. Ulcerative colitis (option d) is another form of IBD that can present with similar symptoms, but fistula formation is less common in UC and more commonly associated with CD. Irritable bowel syndrome (option e) may present with similar symptoms, but does not involve inflammation and other serious complications like CD. Hence, based on the given symptoms, CD is the single most likely diagnosis for this patient.",c,c,TRUE,
1407. a 45yo man has undergone detox and now wants a drug to stop him from craving alcohol. what med would be that drug of choice?,a. disulfiram,b. acamprosate,c. thiamine,d. naloxone,e. diazepam,,,,,,key: the key is b. acamprosate. [disulfirum is a deterrent which does not reduce craving. acramposate by restoring deranged brain chemical reduces craving].,"The correct answer to the question would be b. Acamprosate. This medication works by restoring the normal balance of brain chemicals that are disrupted by long-term alcohol use. It is designed to reduce cravings for alcohol and is often used in combination with counseling and support groups for individuals in recovery from alcohol addiction. Disulfiram is not a drug that reduces cravings but rather a medication that acts as a deterrent to drinking alcohol by causing unpleasant side effects when alcohol is consumed. Thiamine, naloxone, and diazepam are not drugs that specifically target alcohol cravings and would not be the drug of choice in this scenario. Thus, acamprosate would be the most appropriate medication to help this patient stop craving alcohol and support his recovery.",b,b,TRUE,
1408. a 68yo man awoke to find that he is unable to close his left eye and dribbling saliva from the left angle of his mouth. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. facial nerve,b. glossopharyngeal nerve,c. hypoglossal nerve,d. optic nerve,e. vagus nerve,,,,,,key: the key is a. facial nerve. [features are suggestive of left sided facial nerve palsy].,"The correct answer is a. facial nerve, as the features described in the case are indicative of left-sided facial nerve palsy. The facial nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the face, including those involved in eye closure and saliva secretion. Glossopharyngeal nerve and hypoglossal nerve are involved in swallowing and tongue movements, respectively, and do not manifest in the patient's presenting symptoms. The optic nerve is responsible for vision, which is not affected in this case. The vagus nerve controls several vital functions such as heart rate and gastrointestinal motility and is not directly involved in facial movements. Therefore, option a. facial nerve is the most appropriate choice.",a,a,TRUE,
1409. a 19yo female dx with trichomonas vaginalis. lmp was 10d ago. what is the best antibiotic tx?,a. erythromycin,b. vancomycin,c. metronidazole,d. penicillin,e. clarithromycin,f. doxycycline,g. fluconazole,h. clotrimazole,,,key: the key is c. metronidazole.,"The correct answer is c. metronidazole. Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by parasitic protozoa. The most effective treatment of this condition is metronidazole which acts by disrupting the DNA of the parasite leading to its death. Other antibiotic options such as erythromycin, vancomycin, penicillin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, fluconazole and clotrimazole are not the recommended treatment for trichomoniasis. Erythromycin, vancomycin, penicillin, and clarithromycin are commonly used to treat bacterial infections whereas doxycycline is mostly used in the treatment of acne, malaria and some bacterial infections. Fluconazole and clotrimazole are effective anti-fungal agents recommended for the treatment of fungal infections.",c,c,TRUE,

Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). While the individual does present with symptoms commonly associated with allergic rhinitis and asthma (choice A), the additional symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and tender subcutaneous nodules are not consistent with those conditions. Additionally, both cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (choice C) and extrinsic allergic alveolitis (choice D) typically present with respiratory symptoms, which are not the focus of this individual's symptoms. Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (choice E) is also unlikely given the absence of certain key symptoms, such as fever or weight loss. However, the individual's symptoms do match the American College of Rheumatology's criteria for a diagnosis of CSS, including peripheral neuropathy and the presence of subcutaneous nodules. Additionally, the fact that the individual is responding well to corticosteroids further supports a diagnosis of CSS, as these medications are commonly used to treat the condition. Therefore, the single most appropriate diagnosis for this individual is B. Churg-Strauss syndrome.",b,b,TRUE,

[as there is no history of amenorrhea ectopic pregnancy is less likely. so dx is possible ovarian torsion].,"Based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis for the 28-year-old woman with sudden onset vomiting and pain in the right iliac fossa is ovarian torsion (D). This is because the exam shows a mobile swelling in the right iliac fossa and there is no history of amenorrhea which would suggest ectopic pregnancy (A) as a diagnosis. Moreover, there are no significant signs of infection such as fever or leukocytosis to indicate tubo-ovarian abscess (B) or acute appendicitis (C). Diverticulitis (E) is unlikely as it usually presents in older patients. Therefore, based on the given information, ovarian torsion is the most probable diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,
"1412. a 68yo man on tx for an irregular heart beat comes to the ed. he has palpitations for the last 3h. exam: pulse=regular, 154bpm. carotid sinus massage settled his pulse down to 80bpm. what is the most likely rhythm disturbance?",a. svt,b. v-fib,c. vt,d. v-ectopics,e. a-fib,,,,,,key: the key is a. svt. [regular tachycardia responding to vagal maneuver is likely svt].,"The most likely rhythm disturbance is a. SVT (supraventricular tachycardia). The patient's regular pulse and response to carotid sinus massage suggest a narrow complex tachycardia originating above the ventricles, which is characteristic of SVT. V-fib (ventricular fibrillation) and VT (ventricular tachycardia) are rhythms with irregular or wide complex pulses, and they would not respond to vagal maneuver. V-ectopics (ventricular ectopic beats) are isolated premature beats, not sustained tachycardias. A-fib (atrial fibrillation) is a common irregular tachycardia, but it would not respond to carotid sinus massage as the conduction pathway is already chaotic. Therefore, SVT is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
"1413. a 43yo man with a hx of hospital admissions talk about various topics, moving from one loosely connected topic to another. what is the most likely dx?",a. psychosis,b. mania,c. schizophrenia,d. pressured speech,e. verbal diarrhea,,,,,,key: the key is b. mania. [flight of idea is common in mania].,"The correct answer is B, mania. This diagnosis is likely due to the patient's loose associations and rapid change of topics, also known as flight of ideas, which is a common symptom of mania. Psychosis, schizophrenia, pressured speech, and verbal diarrhea are not likely to be the correct diagnosis in this case. Psychosis is a general term for a loss of contact with reality, but does not specifically describe the patient's symptoms. Schizophrenia typically includes symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Pressured speech refers to speaking quickly and obsessively, but this symptom alone is not enough to diagnose the patient. Verbal diarrhea is a more colloquial term for rapid, excessive speech that does not necessarily have a medical diagnosis. Overall, the most appropriate diagnosis in this case is likely to be mania due to the patient's flight of ideas and past hospital admissions.",b,b,TRUE,

HSP is an acute immunoglobulin A (IgA)-mediated disorder that affects small vessels in various parts of the body, including the skin, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, joints, lungs, and central nervous system (CNS). This condition typically presents with a characteristic purpuric rash on the lower extremities and buttocks as well as abdominal pain, arthritis, and renal involvement. Other symptoms may include fever, malaise, and joint swelling. TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) and HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome) are associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, but they usually present with more severe symptoms such as neurologic abnormalities and renal failure. ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura) presents primarily with bleeding manifestations such as petechiae, ecchymoses, and mucosal bleeding. Measles usually presents initially with fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis before the development of a maculopapular rash. Therefore, the diagnosis of HSP is the most probable in this case due to the typical presentation of the patient's symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,

[loop diuretics causes hyponatremia and hypokalemia].","Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, produce the effect of low sodium (Na+) and low potassium (K+) levels in the body, which is the correct answer choice (a). This is due to the mechanism of action of loop diuretics, which inhibit the reabsorption of Na+ and K+ in the ascending loop of Henle in the kidneys, leading to increased excretion of these ions in the urine. This can result in hyponatremia and hypokalemia in patients taking loop diuretics. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not reflect the known physiological effects of loop diuretics on sodium and potassium levels in the body. Answer choice (b) suggests normal sodium levels but this is not typically seen with loop diuretics. Answer choice (c) suggests normal levels of both sodium and potassium, which is unlikely with patients on loop diuretics. Answer choice (d) suggests high sodium levels, which is opposite of what loop diuretics do, but low potassium levels is still correct. Finally, answer choice (e) suggests high levels of both sodium and potassium, which is again unlikely in patients taking loop diuretics.",a,a,TRUE,

[reflux nephropathy is kidney damage (nephropathy) due to urine flowing backward (reflux) from the bladder toward the kidneys; the latter is called vesicoureteral reflux (vur)].,"The correct answer for the cause of renal failure in a 6-year-old girl with a congenital abnormality of the ureter insertion into the bladder is e. reflux nephropathy. This condition is characterized by urine flowing backward from the bladder towards the kidneys, causing kidney damage or nephropathy. The backward flow of urine is known as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). SLE, PKD, Wilms' tumor, and acute tubular necrosis are unlikely to cause renal failure in this case, considering the given information. SLE is an autoimmune disorder that can affect various organs, including the kidneys, but it is not associated with a congenital abnormality of the ureter insertion. PKD or polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of cysts in the kidneys, which may lead to renal failure, but it is not associated with VUR. Wilms' tumor is a type of kidney cancer that usually presents as a painless abdominal mass in children, but it is not a cause of congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract. Acute tubular necrosis is a medical condition characterized by the death of the tubular cells in the kidneys. It is usually caused by ischemia, toxins, or other medical conditions. However, congenital abnormalities of the ureter insertion are not a known cause. Therefore, reflux nephropathy is the most likely cause of renal failure in a 6-year-old girl with this congenital abnormality, and the other options are not related to this condition.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because the patient experienced a brief episode of rapid pounding in the chest which was not sustained for more than 30 seconds, ruling out non-sustained VT. Additionally, the patient remained conscious throughout, ruling out sustained VT which is commonly associated with syncope. The most likely explanation for these symptoms is runs of v-ectopics.

[features are consistent with lobar pneumonia].,"The correct answer for this question is c. Streptococcus. This is because the features described, including the lobar consolidation on a chest x-ray, are consistent with lobar pneumonia caused by Streptococcus. The patient's CD4 count of 350 suggests that he may have HIV, which puts him at a higher risk for infectious pneumonia. Option a, Mycobacterium avium intercellular, and option e, Pneumocystis jerovici, are also possible causes of pneumonia in HIV patients, but they typically present with different radiographic features. Option b, CMV, and option d, Toxoplasmosis, are not typically associated with pneumonia. Therefore, the single most appropriate option in this scenario is c. Streptococcus.",c,c,TRUE,

[pid is a risk factor for ectopic pregnancy].,"The most probable diagnosis in this case is a. ectopic pregnancy. This is because the patient has a previous history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a known risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Additionally, the patient is experiencing severe abdominal pain and has missed her last menstrual period by 8 weeks, which are both indicative of ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian torsion and hematometrium are unlikely diagnoses in this case. Chronic PID could be a possibility but would not present with sudden severe abdominal pain. Cholecystitis is not indicated as there are no symptoms suggesting issues with the gallbladder. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is an ectopic pregnancy, and immediate medical attention is necessary to prevent serious complications.",a,a,TRUE,

The presence of a previous breast lump and the current 1cm size, smooth, firm (not hard), discrete, and mobile (not fixed) characteristics of the lump are suggestive of a fibro-adenoma. Breast abscess and carcinoma are less likely given the absence of accompanying symptoms such as pain, redness or inflammation, skin changes or discharge, and the relatively young age of the patient. Breast cyst and sebaceous cyst can also be considered less probable as they have a different consistency on palpation than that found in fibro-adenoma.

This is because there is a high chance of repeat overdose and the woman is expressing a desire to be discharged, which may indicate a lack of understanding of the seriousness of her situation. Community psychiatric nurse visit (answer a) may not provide the level of supervision and support needed to prevent further harm. Psychiatric opd review (answer b) may not be timely enough to address the immediate risk of overdose. Prescribing anti-depressants (answer c) does not address the immediate risk of overdose and may not be appropriate without a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. Discharging the woman (answer e) without proper evaluation and treatment may put her at risk of further harm. Therefore, admission under the mental health act is the most appropriate management in this case.",d,d,TRUE,
1423. a 63yo male presents after having had a seizure. exam: alert and oriented. exam: inattention on the left side and hyperreflexia of the arm. what is the most probable dx?,a. cerebral tumor,b. pituitary adenoma,c. cerebellar abscess,d. huntington’s chorea,e. parkinsonism,,,,,,key: the key is a. cerebral tumour.,"Based on the given information, the most probable diagnosis for this 63-year-old male who presented with a seizure, inattention on the left side, and hyperreflexia of the arm is a cerebral tumor. The presence of a seizure and neurological symptoms such as inattention and hyperreflexia suggest an underlying neurological condition such as a brain tumor. Pituitary adenoma can also present with similar symptoms but usually manifests with endocrine symptoms as well. Cerebellar abscess and Huntington’s chorea are less likely due to the absence of relevant symptoms, while Parkinsonism is also an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Overall, the combination of symptoms alongside the patient's age and medical history strongly support the diagnosis of a cerebral tumor.",a,a,TRUE,
"1424. a 70yo lady on raloxifene for osteoporosis has recently to the uk from australia. she now presents with severe chest pain, sob and suddenly collapsed in the ed. what is the single most appropriate dx?",a. mi,b. aortic dissection,c. pulmonary embolism,d. costochondritis,e. pneumothorax,,,,,,key: the key is c. pulmonary embolism. [prolonged air travel is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism].,"The correct answer is c. pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a condition where a blood clot travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow. Risk factors for a pulmonary embolism include prolonged air travel, as well as being over 60 years old, having a history of cancer, and taking estrogen or hormone replacement therapy. The patient's recent travel from Australia and presentation of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and collapse in the ED are all consistent with a pulmonary embolism. Choice a, myocardial infarction, may present with chest pain but is less likely given the patient's age and history of osteoporosis. Choice b, aortic dissection, may also present with chest pain but is less likely given the sudden onset of symptoms and presentation in the ED. Choices d and e, costochondritis and pneumothorax, respectively, do not fit with the patient's presentation of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and collapse in the ED. Therefore, the single most appropriate diagnosis is c. pulmonary embolism.",c,c,TRUE,
1425. a 35yo woman complains of hoarseness of voice 3h after partial thyroidectomy. she had no hx of phonation probs before the surgery. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. laryngoscopy,b. bronchoscopy,c. ct neck,d. cxr,e. barium swallow,,,,,,key: the key is a. laryngoscopy. [probable diagnosis is recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy].,"The single most appropriate investigation for a 35-year-old woman complaining of hoarseness of voice 3 hours after partial thyroidectomy is a laryngoscopy. The probable diagnosis for her symptoms is recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, which is a known risk of thyroid surgery. Laryngoscopy will allow for visualization of the vocal cords and can confirm this diagnosis. Bronchoscopy, CT neck, CXR, and barium swallow are not appropriate investigations for this presentation and do not evaluate the integrity or function of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Therefore, laryngoscopy stands as the most appropriate investigation for this particular scenario.",a,a,TRUE,
"1426. a 40yo pt came to opd with complaint of fever, pleuritic chest pain, productive cough and painful vesicles around the lips. exam: temp=38c. he has a hx of splenectomy last yr. what is the single most likely causative organism?",a. pneumococcal pneumonia,b. staphylococcus,c. klebsiella,d. streptococcus,e. chlamydia psitacci,,,,,,key: the key is a. pneumococcal pneumonia. [painful vesicles around the lips is well known association of pneumococcal pneumonia. also pleuritic chest pain and productive cough are present in pneumococcal pneumonia].,"Based on the given presentation and medical history of the patient, the most likely causative organism for the symptoms described is a. pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia is known to cause painful vesicles around the lips and it also presents with pleuritic chest pain and productive cough, all of which the patient is experiencing. The patient's previous history of splenectomy also puts him at a higher risk for pneumococcal infection. Staphylococcus, klebsiella, and streptococcus can also cause pneumonia, but they do not typically present with painful vesicles around the lips. Chlamydia psittaci is not a common cause of pneumonia and is not a likely option in this case. Therefore, based on the given information, the most likely causative organism for the patient's symptoms is a. pneumococcal pneumonia.",a,a,TRUE,
"1427. a 37yo male pt who recently returned back to uk from uae attends the opd with complaint of dry cough, breathlessness and anorexia. according to him he had flu like symptoms a week ago. he is slightly confused. inv: lymphopenia & decreased na+. cxr: bi-basal consolidation. what is the single most likely causative organism?",a. legionella,b. chlamydia pneumonia,c. pcp,d. viral pneumonia,e. chlamydia psitacci,,,,,,"key: the key is a. legionella. [h/o travel (staying in ac and watersystem of hotel), lymphopenia, decreased na+, bi-basal consolidation are well known features of legionnaires disease].","The single most likely causative organism in this case is Legionella, which is supported by the presence of specific symptoms and radiological findings. The patient has a history of travel and staying in a hotel's air conditioning and water system, both of which are known to be common sources of Legionella exposure. Additionally, lymphopenia and decreased sodium levels are well-known features of Legionnaires' disease. The bi-basal consolidation seen on the chest x-ray is also a typical finding in Legionella pneumonia. Therefore, options b, c, d, and e are unlikely causes given the clinical presentation and findings.",a,a,TRUE,
"1428. a 20yo student came to the opd with complains of headache, malaise, dry cough, joint pain and vomiting. exam: temp=39c. cxr: patchy consolidation. what is the single most likely causative organism?",a. pneumococcal pneumonia,b. mycoplasma,c. klebsiella,d. streptococcus,e. pcp,,,,,,key: the key is b. mycoplasma.,"The correct answer to the question is b. Mycoplasma. This is because the symptoms and CXR findings suggest atypical pneumonia, which is commonly caused by Mycoplasma. This organism does not have a cell wall, making it resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis like penicillin. Pneumococcal pneumonia (a), Klebsiella (c), and Streptococcus (d) are all causes of typical pneumonia, which presents with lobar consolidations on CXR. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (e) is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients and presents with diffuse infiltrates on CXR. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and CXR findings, Mycoplasma is the most likely causative organism while the other choices are less likely.",b,b,TRUE,
"1429. a 45yo man presented to his gp with vague symptoms of headache, proximal muscle weakness and nocturia. test results show him to be severely htn (230/130mmhg) and hypokalemic. what is the most probable dx?",a. addison’s disease,b. conn’s disease,c. familial hyperaldosteronism,d. cushing’s disease,e. cushing’s syndrome,,,,,,key: the key is b. conn’s disease. [high bp is often the only presentation of conn’s syndrome. loss of k+ in urine leads to hypokalemia which in turn causes muscle weakness and polyuria particularly nocturia].,"Based on the patient's symptoms of headache, proximal muscle weakness, and nocturia, along with severe hypertension and hypokalemia in test results, the most probable diagnosis is Conn's disease (answer b). Conn's disease, also known as primary aldosteronism, is caused by the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, leading to high blood pressure that can be difficult to manage. The loss of potassium in urine due to aldosterone excess can result in hypokalemia, which can lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness and increased urination, especially at night (nocturia). Addison's disease (answer a) is caused by inadequate production of hormones by the adrenal glands, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and hypotension. Familial hyperaldosteronism (answer c) is a rare genetic condition that also causes excessive production of aldosterone, leading to hypertension and low potassium levels. Cushing's disease (answer d) and syndrome (answer e) are caused by excessive production of cortisol, resulting in a variety of symptoms including weight gain, diabetes, and high blood pressure. None of these other conditions would explain the patient's specific symptoms of severe hypertension and hypokalemia, supporting the answer of Conn's disease as the most probable diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
1430. a man says his insides are rotting and nobody has burried him. which term best describes his condition?,a. delusion of nihilism,b. delusion of guilt,c. delusion of persecution,d. incongruent affect,e. clang association,,,,,,key: the key is a. delusion of nihilism.,"The correct answer is A. delusion of nihilism, which is a type of delusion where the individual believes that the world is devoid of meaning, purpose or value. In this particular scenario, the individual believes that his insides are rotting which may imply that he has a belief that his physical body is decaying or falling apart. This belief is based on the delusion of nihilism which leads him to think that nothing matters and that he deserves to be left unburied. Option B is incorrect as delusion of guilt would involve the individual feeling a sense of guilt over something that they did or did not do. Option C is also incorrect as delusion of persecution is a type of delusion where the individual believes that others are out to harm them. Option D incongruent affect refers to a mismatch between the expressed emotion and the content of speech. Finally, option E clang association refers to a thought disorder where individuals speak in a way that is characterized by using words that sound alike but have no logical connection to each other.",a,a,TRUE,
1431. a man with chronic cough presents with copious purulent sputum. what is the single most dx?,a. bronchitis,b. bronchiectasis,c. copd,d. pneumonia,e. emphysema,,,,,,key: the key is b. bronchiectasis.,"The correct answer for this question is option B: Bronchiectasis. This is because in bronchiectasis, the airways become permanently dilated and inflamed, leading to increased production of sputum and chronic cough. The other options are incorrect because chronic cough and purulent sputum are not the defining features of those conditions. Bronchitis refers to an acute or subacute inflammation of the airways, COPD is a progressive lung disease that causes breathing difficulty, pneumonia is a lung infection, and emphysema is a form of COPD where the alveoli are damaged. Therefore, based on the symptoms presented in the question, Bronchiectasis is the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
"1432. a 32yo man working in a shipyard comes with sob. exam: dullness on left side of the chest, pain in left side of chest, pleuritic rub and crackles been heard on the same side. what is the single most likely dx?",a. pericarditis,b. pleurisy,c. pleural effusion,d. ccf,e. tb,,,,,,key: the key is c. pleural effusion. [shipyard worker are exposed to asbestos and presenting case has developed mesothelioma causing pleura thickening and pleural effusion. though it is usual that in pleural effusion pleural rub reduces or becomes absent but it is also possible to get pleural rub even in pleural effusion and the like diagnosis is pleural effusion here].,"The single most likely diagnosis for the 32-year-old shipyard worker presenting with a dullness on the left side of the chest, pain on the left side of the chest, pleuritic rub, and crackles is pleural effusion (option C). The exposure to asbestos in shipyards increases the risk of mesothelioma, a type of cancer that can cause pleural thickening and effusion. Although it is typical for pleural rub to reduce or become absent in pleural effusion, it is still possible to have a pleural rub. Pericarditis (option A), congestive heart failure (option D), and tuberculosis (option E) may present with shortness of breath but are less likely given the presentation and occupational history. Pleurisy (option B) is a vague term that could describe various conditions, but the presence of pleural effusion makes this choice less likely. Therefore, the single most likely diagnosis for this patient is pleural effusion due to asbestos exposure.",c,c,TRUE,
"1433. a 67yo female presents with balance prbs. exam: nystagmus on left lateral gaze, a loss of the left corneal reflex and reduced hearing in the left ear. what is the most likely dx?",a. meniere’s disease,b. acoustic neuroma,c. cerebral abscess,d. pituitary tumor,e. gentamicin,,,,,,"key: the key is b. acoustic neuroma. [nystagmus, loss of corneal reflex, hearing loss, balance problem are well known feature of acoustic neuroma].","Based on the patient's presentation and exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is b. acoustic neuroma. This is because nystagmus, loss of corneal reflex, hearing loss, and balance problems are well-known features of acoustic neuroma. Meniere's disease, on the other hand, typically presents with vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in both ears, and cerebral abscess and pituitary tumor are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms. Gentamicin is an antibiotic and not a potential cause of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, option b is the most appropriate answer, and the other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation and exam findings.",b,b,TRUE,
1434. a 22yo man reports a 2d hx of hoarseness of voice. he denies any weight loss but he has been smoking for 4yrs. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. none,b. laryngoscopy,c. bronchoscopy,d. bal,e. cxr,,,,,,key: the key is b. laryngoscopy. it is a wrong key! correct key is a. none. [if horseness is of >3 weeks in man >50 yrs and smoker and heavy drinker to rule out cancer do cxr and\or laryngoscopy- nice guideline].,"The correct answer to this question is a. none. According to the NICE guideline, laryngoscopy or CXR should only be considered if hoarseness persists for more than 3 weeks in males over the age of 50 who are heavy smokers and drinkers, in order to rule out cancer. In this case, the patient is only 22 years old and has only been smoking for 4 years, which makes it less likely that he has developed cancer. Therefore, there is no need for any invasive investigations at this stage and the appropriate course of action would be to advise the patient to quit smoking and return if his symptoms persist. Bronchoscopy and BAL are invasive investigations that are not appropriate for this patient's presentation. It is important to follow evidence-based guidelines to avoid unnecessary investigations and potential harm to the patient.",b,b,TRUE,
1435. a 34yo ivda (intravenous drug addict) presents with a 4m hx of productive cough. he has lost 10kgs. what is the single most appropriate inv?,a. sputum for afb,b. laryngoscopy,c. bronchoscopy,d. ct neck,e. cxr,,,,,,key: the key is a. sputum for afb. [in ivda immunity becomes low and easily gets infected with tb].,"The single most appropriate investigation for the 34-year-old intravenous drug addict presenting with a 4-month history of productive cough and significant weight loss is option A, sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). As an IVDA, the patient is at increased risk of tuberculosis due to their low immunity. By examining the patient's sputum for AFB, we can diagnose whether they have an active tuberculosis infection, which can then be treated with appropriate medication. The other options, including laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, CT neck, and CXR, are not as appropriate as sputum for AFB because they do not directly examine the patient's respiratory system for tuberculosis.",a,a,TRUE,
"1436. a 25yo pt came to the opd with complaint of fever, malaise, breathlessness, cough and anorexia. his gf has got similar symptoms. he had hx of sore throat and ear discharge a month ago. what is the single most likely causative organism?",a. legionella,b. mycoplasma,c. chlamydia pneumonia,d. pcp,e. chlamydia psitacci,,,,,,key: the key is c. chlamydia pneumonia.,"Based on the symptoms and the patient's history, the most likely causative organism is Chlamydia pneumoniae (choice c). The symptoms of fever, malaise, breathlessness, cough and anorexia are consistent with pneumonia, and the patient's recent history of a sore throat and ear discharge suggests an upper respiratory tract infection which could have spread to the lungs. Both the patient and their girlfriend presenting with similar symptoms also points to a contagious bacterial infection. Legionella (choice a) and Mycoplasma (choice b) are two other common causes of pneumonia, but they typically present with different symptoms such as headache and muscle pain, or a milder cough respectively. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) (choice d) is caused by a fungus and is usually seen in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV/AIDS, which is not mentioned in this patient's history. Chlamydia psittaci (choice e) can cause a type of pneumonia known as psittacosis, which is rare and typically acquired from birds. Therefore, the most likely causative organism is Chlamydia pneumoniae based on the patient's symptoms and history, and the other choices can be ruled out based on the lack of fit with the presented case.",c,c,TRUE,

[even trivial head trauma can lead to subdural hematoma. presence of small scalp laceration, confusion and becoming increasingly drowsy glasgow coma scale of 8 are suggestive of subdural hematoma].","The correct answer is d, subdural hematoma. This is suggested by the presence of a small scalp laceration, confusion, and becoming increasingly drowsy with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8. Subdural hematoma is a serious condition that can occur even with trivial head trauma. The other choices are unlikely given the presented symptoms. Infection toxicity and delirium tremens typically present with other signs and symptoms, such as fever and altered mental status, and are less likely in the absence of such findings. Extradural hematoma is less common in elderly patients and typically presents with a more rapid onset of symptoms. Electrolyte imbalances can lead to confusion, but again, the presented symptoms suggest a more serious condition such as subdural hematoma.",d,d,TRUE,

[upper lobe cavitation favours klebsiella pneumonia. also it is well known that staphylococcal and klebsiella pneumonia are more common in dm than normal person].,"The most likely causative organism for a 50-year-old diabetic patient with upper lobe cavitation on chest x-ray, presenting with symptoms of fever, muscle ache, dry cough, and anorexia is d. Klebsiella. This is supported by the fact that upper lobe cavitation favors Klebsiella pneumonia, and it is well-known that Klebsiella pneumonia and staphylococcal pneumonia are more common in diabetic patients than in normal individuals. Therefore, choices a. Legionella, b. Mycoplasma, c. Staphylococcus, and e. Streptococcus are less likely to be the causative organism in this case. It is important to consider the patient's medical history and presentation when making a diagnosis to provide appropriate treatment.",d,d,TRUE,
1439. a 20yo man complains that all his movements are being watched. sometimes he feels as though his actions are being controlled by his radio. at other times he is aware of voices describing what he is doing. what is the most probable dx?,a. mania,b. drug induced psychosis,c. delusion of control,d. schizophrenia,e. korsakoff psychosis,,,,,,key: the key is d. schizophrenia.,"The correct answer is d. schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior. In this case, the individual is experiencing hallucinations, specifically auditory hallucinations, as he hears voices describing what he is doing. He also exhibits delusions of control as he believes his actions are being controlled by his radio. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Mania, drug-induced psychosis, and Korsakoff psychosis are not as probable as they do not fit the individual's symptom profile.",d,d,TRUE,
"1440. a 35yo is agitated and euphoric. he claims to be helping the prime minister with economic policy, although this is not true when checked. what is the most likely dx?",a. mania,b. schizophrenia,c. hypomania,d. drug induced personality disorder,e. delusion of grandeur,,,,,,"key: the key is e. delusion of grandeur. key is wrong! correct key should be mania. [agitated, euphoric and delusion of grandiosity makes the likely dx to be “mania”. agitation and euphoria are not feature of delusion of grandiosity but mania].","The correct answer to this question is ""a. mania"". The patient's presentation of agitation and euphoria, coupled with a delusional belief of grandiosity, suggests the presence of manic symptoms. Mania is a mood disorder characterized by elevated or irritable mood, along with symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and impulsivity. Schizophrenia, on the other hand, is a psychotic disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions that are not necessarily mood related. Hypomania is a milder form of mania, while drug-induced personality disorder is not a recognized mental health diagnosis. Therefore, the likely diagnosis for this patient is mania, as it presents with the characteristic symptoms of elevated mood, agitation, and delusions of grandiosity.",a,a,TRUE,

The key symptoms of low grade fever, night sweats, anorexia, productive cough and upper lobe cavitary lesions are highly suggestive of TB. Mycoplasma is often associated with a non-productive cough, while Klebsiella pneumoniae is typically seen in immunocompromised patients and can cause abscesses in the lungs. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is more commonly seen in patients with HIV/AIDS and presents with a non-productive cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Therefore, given the patient's recent travel history, presentation of symptoms and chest X-ray findings, the most likely causative organism is TB.",c,c,TRUE,

[the likely dx is dka. among the given options abg is the most appropriate inv. to demonstrate acidosis].,"The correct answer is A, ABG. This is because the patient is presenting with dehydration and a low blood pressure, which suggests the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes. ABG (arterial blood gas) testing can confirm the presence of acidosis, a hallmark of DKA, and guide appropriate treatment. CBC (complete blood count), HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) testing, LFT (liver function test), and BUE (blood urea electrolyte) testing are not useful initial tests for DKA and would not provide as much information as an ABG test in this scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

[pruritus, skin pigmentation (increased amounts of melanin, widely dispersed throughout both epidermis and dermis), raised alp, and presence of ama are diagnostic of primary biliary cirrhosis].","Based on the presented information, the single most likely diagnosis for this 45-year-old woman is f. primary biliary cirrhosis. The presence of pruritus, skin pigmentation with increased melanin dispersed widely throughout both the epidermis and dermis, raised alkaline phosphatase (alp), and the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies are all indicative of primary biliary cirrhosis. Psoriasis, scabies, atopic eczema, dermatitis herpetiformis, and hyperthyroidism are unlikely to be the correct diagnosis in this case given the specific clinical and laboratory findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the presented information is primary biliary cirrhosis.",f,f,TRUE,

[given picture is typical of crf].,"The correct answer is f) CRF (chronic renal failure). The patient's complaints of tiredness, lethargy, and itching that is severe after a hot bath are all symptoms of patients with CRF. Additionally, the presence of nocturia and polyuria, generalized edema, and pallor could all be attributed to chronic kidney disease. The other options, including hyperthyroidism, lichen planus, lymphoma, eczema, and liver failure, do not align with the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms is CRF.",f,f,TRUE,
1445. a 30yo man complains of vague pain in the loin with bp=140/90mmhg. he is found to have proteinuria and hematuria. what is the inv to confirm the dx?,a. abdominal us,b. anca,c. ana,d. urine microscopy and culture,e. stool culture,,,,,,key: the key is a. abdominal us. [the likely dx is adpkd for which us is diagnostic investigation].,"The correct answer for this question is A - abdominal US. The symptoms described in the question are indicative of a possible diagnosis of ADPKD, which is Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. This condition is known to cause kidney abnormalities, such as hematuria and proteinuria, and can also lead to high blood pressure. An abdominal ultrasound is a diagnostic investigation that can help to confirm the diagnosis of ADPKD. Choice B - ANCA, is not relevant in this case, as ANCA is a blood test used to diagnose certain types of autoimmune diseases. Similarly, choice C - ANA, is used to diagnose autoimmune diseases and is not relevant in this case. Choice D - urine microscopy and culture, can help identify any infections or abnormalities in the urine, but it won't help confirm the diagnosis of ADPKD. Choice E - stool culture, is entirely irrelevant to this situation and thus has no role to play in confirming the diagnosis of ADPKD. Therefore, the correct answer is A - abdominal US, as it is the most appropriate diagnostic investigation for confirming the suspected diagnosis of ADPKD.",a,a,TRUE,

[the only arrhythmia where we use acute and chronic phase is af. so though the given key is adenosine it is a wrong key!! it is acute phase of atrial fibrillation for which we use beta-blocker. so the answer should be b. metoprolol here].,"The correct answer to the question is b. metoprolol. Although the given key in the question is a. adenosine, this is incorrect. The only arrhythmia where we use acute and chronic phase is atrial fibrillation (AF). In this case, the patient is presenting in the acute phase of AF with a high heart rate and symptoms of palpitations and breathlessness. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment in this phase would be a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, to slow down the heart rate and improve symptoms. The other choices, c. verapamil and d. amiodarone, may be effective treatments for different types of arrhythmias, but in this case, they are not the most appropriate options. Overall, it is important to accurately identify the underlying arrhythmia to ensure proper treatment is given in the acute phase.",a,a,TRUE,

This artery runs in the anterior inter-ventricular groove and supplies blood to a large part of the front and left side of the heart. Option A, the acute marginal branch, is a branch of the right coronary artery that supplies blood to the right side of the heart. Option C, the coronary sinus, is a vein that collects deoxygenated blood from the heart and returns it to the right atrium. Option D, the circumflex artery, supplies blood to the back of the heart. Option E, the right coronary artery, supplies blood to the right side and back of the heart.

The heavy menstrual periods and pallor observed during the examination support this diagnosis, as IDA is a common complication of heavy menstrual bleeding. Lichen planus (choice b) and dermatitis herpetiformis (choice c) are both skin conditions that can cause itching, but they are usually associated with characteristic skin lesions that were not mentioned in the scenario provided. Eczema (choice d) is another skin condition that can cause itching, but again, there were no specific skin lesions reported in the case. Uremia (choice e) is a condition characterized by high levels of urea in the blood as a result of kidney failure. While it can cause pruritus, it is unlikely to be the causative factor in this case given the absence of other signs and symptoms of kidney disease. Therefore, based on the information presented, the most likely explanation for the woman's symptoms and exam findings is IDA.",a,a,TRUE,
1451. a 7yo child presents with lesions on the trunk. exam: some lesions are weeping and others are crusted with a red base. what is the causative organism?,a. herpes simplex,b. varicella zoster,c. rubella virus,d. herpes zoster,,,,,,,key: the key is b. varicella zoster.,"The correct answer to the question is b. Varicella zoster. This virus causes chickenpox in children, presenting as lesions on the trunk, face, and limbs. The virus can remain dormant in nerve roots for years, and can reactivate as herpes zoster (shingles) in adults with decreased immunity. Therefore, choices a and d, herpes simplex and herpes zoster respectively, are not correct as they are different viruses. Choice c, the rubella virus, causes a rash that typically starts on the face and spreads to the trunk, but does not usually present with weeping or crusted lesions. In summary, the presence of weeping and crusted lesions on the trunk in a child points towards a diagnosis of chickenpox caused by varicella zoster.",b,b,TRUE,
"1452. an 87yo woman with a hx of htn has acute breathlessness. she has a rr=32bpm, widespread lung crackles, pulse=120bpm, bp=160/90mmhg and elevated venous pressure. her peripheral o2 sat=85%. what is the single most appropriate initial management?",a. iv antibiotics,b. iv furosemide,c. nitrate infusion,d. neb. salbutamol,e. 100% oxygen,,,,,,key: the key is e. 100% oxygen. [most appropriate initial management is e. 100% oxygen.oxygen saturation is low. so we have to give oxygen initially].,"The single most appropriate initial management for an 87-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and acute breathlessness, who has a rapid respiratory rate, widespread lung crackles, elevated pulse and blood pressure, and low peripheral oxygen saturation of 85%, is choice E, administering 100% oxygen. This is because the patient's oxygen saturation is low and providing oxygen will help to improve her respiratory distress. Choices A and B, administering IV antibiotics or furosemide, respectively, are not indicated because there is no evidence of infection or fluid overload. Choice C, nitrate infusion, is not appropriate because it would lower blood pressure further, which is already elevated. Choice D, nebulized salbutamol, may be considered if the patient has underlying lung disease, however, it is not the single most appropriate initial management in this case.",e,e,TRUE,
"1453. a 25yo man presented with painless cervical lymphadenopathy with lethargy, night sweats and itching. what is the single most likely causative factor?",a. lymphoma,b. polycythemia,c. ida,d. uremia,e. drug induced,,,,,,"key: the key is a. lymphoma. [cervical lymphadenopathy, lethargy, night sweats and itching are well known features of lymphoma].","The single most likely causative factor for a 25-year-old man presenting with painless cervical lymphadenopathy, lethargy, night sweats, and itching is lymphoma. These symptoms are well known features of lymphoma. Polycythemia, iron deficiency anemia (IDA), uremia, and drug-induced causes are not commonly associated with these symptoms. Therefore, lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis, and medical attention should be sought immediately for proper diagnosis and treatment.",a,a,TRUE,
"1454. a 25yo male presents with fever and pain in the right lower thigh of 1m duration. exam: lower third of his thigh is red, hot and tender. the xr showed new bone formation. what is the most probable dx?",a. osteosarcomoa,b. ewing’s sarcoma,c. tuberculus arthritis,d. exotosis,e. fibrosarcoma,,,,,,key: the key is b. ewing’s sarcoma.,"The correct answer is b. Ewing's sarcoma. The presenting symptoms of fever, pain and redness in the lower thigh, along with the appearance of new bone formation on an X-ray, are indicative of this type of cancer, which usually affects young people. Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that develops in the long bones of the body, such as the femur and tibia. Osteosarcoma, which is another type of bone cancer, usually presents with pain and swelling in the affected area, but not with fever nor redness. Tuberculous arthritis is an infectious condition caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that affects the joints, but typically there are no systemic symptoms such a fever. Exotosis, also known as osteochondroma, is a benign growth of bone and cartilage that typically occurs in younger individuals. Fibrosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that develops in the fibrous tissue of the body, usually arising from the muscles or tendons. Therefore, the symptoms and X-ray findings described in this case suggest a diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, and the other choices should be excluded based on their distinct characteristics.",b,b,TRUE,
"1455. a 76yo man presents with sore throat, local irritation by hot food, dysphagia and a sensation of a lump in his throat. he has a 20y hx of smoking. what is the single most likely dx?",a. nasopharyngeal ca,b. pharyngeal ca,c. sinus squamous cell ca,d. squamous cell laryngeal ca,e. hypopharyngeal ca,,,,,,key: the key is b. pharyngeal ca.,"The key to this question is b. pharyngeal ca. Given the patient's presentation of sore throat, local irritation by hot food, dysphagia, and a sensation of a lump in his throat, it is likely that he has a pharyngeal cancer. This is supported by his 20-year history of smoking, as smoking is a known risk factor for the development of pharyngeal cancer. The other answer choices are less likely based on the given presentation and smoking history. Nasopharyngeal cancer, for example, would present with different symptoms such as nasal congestion and nosebleeds. Sinus squamous cell cancer would present with symptoms such as chronic sinusitis and facial pain. Squamous cell laryngeal cancer would present with hoarseness and difficulty speaking. Hypopharyngeal cancer would present with difficulty swallowing and weight loss. Therefore, the correct answer is b. pharyngeal cancer, based on the patient's presentation and smoking history.",b,b,TRUE,
1456. a 42yo female who is obese comes with severe upper abdominal pain and right shoulder tip pain with a temp=37.8c. she has 5 children. what is the most probable dx?,a. ercp,b. lft,c. serum amylase,d. mrcp,e. us abdomen,,,,,,"key: the key is us abdomen. [5 “f”. fat, female, fair, forty, fertile = cholecystitis].","The most probable diagnosis for the 42-year-old obese female with severe upper abdominal pain and right shoulder tip pain, along with a temperature of 37.8°C, and having five children is cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. The key provided for the question helps in understanding this diagnosis as it indicates that the presence of ""5 F's"" - fat, female, fair, forty, and fertile - is a risk factor for cholecystitis. The correct answer, therefore, is E: US abdomen. This is because an ultrasound (US) of the abdomen is a non-invasive and commonly used diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of gallstones, which cause cholecystitis. The other choices - ERCP, LFT, serum amylase, and MRCP - are not the most probable diagnostic tests for cholecystitis as they are either invasive or used to diagnose other conditions such as pancreatitis or liver disorders. Therefore, an US abdomen is the best diagnostic choice for this patient's symptoms, along with potential laboratory tests and a detailed medical history to confirm a diagnosis of cholecystitis.",e,e,TRUE,
1457. a 37yo laborer comes with hx of redness of left eye with foreign body sensation in the same eye. what is the single most appropriate option?,a. ciliary body,b. sclera,c. conjunctivitis,d. cornea,e. iris,,,,,,key: the key is d. cornea. [redness with foreign body sensation of eye in a labourer are most likely due to foreign body in cornea].,"The correct answer is D, cornea. Redness with foreign body sensation in the eye in a laborer is most likely due to a foreign body in the cornea. The cornea is the clear outer layer of the eye that covers the iris and pupil, and is responsible for refracting light. The ciliary body is responsible for producing aqueous humor that fills the anterior chamber of the eye, but it is not typically associated with redness or foreign body sensation. The sclera is the white, fibrous outer layer of the eye, and inflammation of the sclera (scleritis) may cause redness, but not typically with foreign body sensation. Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin, clear membrane that covers the white of the eye, but it typically presents with more generalized redness and often with discharge, rather than with foreign body sensation. Therefore, D, cornea, is the single most appropriate option for a laborer presenting with redness and foreign body sensation in the eye.",d,d,TRUE,
1458. an 11yo boy came to the hospital with pain after falling off his bicycle. xr= fx at distal radius with forward angulations. what is the single most probable dx?,a. dinner fork deformity,b. cubitus valgus,c. gun stock deformity,d. garden spade deformity,e. genu valgus,,,,,,key: the key is d. garden spade deformity.,"The correct answer to the question is d. garden spade deformity. This type of deformity is commonly associated with fractures of the distal radius, particularly in children. When the radius is fractured and displaced, it can angle forward resulting in a deformity that looks like the shape of a garden spade. The other choices are unlikely in this scenario as they refer to deformities that occur in different bones or due to different mechanisms of injury. For example, dinner fork deformity occurs in fractures of the proximal ulna, cubitus valgus is a deformity of the elbow due to growth plate abnormalities, gun stock deformity is associated with forearm fractures, and genu valgus is a condition affecting the knees. Therefore, based on the information provided, garden spade deformity is the most probable diagnosis.",d,d,TRUE,
1459. a middle aged man with a lump in front of his neck which moves up while he’s swallowing. us shows a mass replacing the left lobe of thyroid. and spread to the sternocleidomastoid and adjacent muscles. what is the most probable dx?,a. thyroid ca,b. pharyngeal pouch,c. bronchus ca,d. thyroid cyst,e. larynx ca,,,,,,key: the key is a. thyroid ca.,"The correct answer to this question is A, thyroid cancer. A lump in the front of the neck that moves upward while swallowing is a classic symptom of thyroid cancer. The ultrasound results showing a mass replacing the left lobe of the thyroid and spread to adjacent muscles also point towards thyroid cancer. Pharyngeal pouch, bronchus cancer, thyroid cyst, and larynx cancer are all unlikely diagnoses when compared to the presenting symptom of a moving neck lump and the ultrasound findings. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is thyroid cancer.",a,a,TRUE,
1460. a 28yo male complains of severe pain while trying to grasp any object. it started since he participated in skiing and had a fall and caught his thumb in the matting. exam: rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament of mcp joint of the thumb. what is the single most probable deformity?,a. dinner fork deformity,b. game keeper thumb,c. mallet finger,d. gun stock deformity,e. garden spade deformity,,,,,,key: the key is b. game keeper thumb. [gamekeeper's thumb is an insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament (ucl) of the metacarpophalangeal (mcp) joint of the thumb].,"The correct answer is B, gamekeeper's thumb. This injury is an insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb, which occurs when the thumb is forced away from the hand. In this case, the patient experienced a fall while skiing that resulted in a rupture of the UCL. The other choices are not related to this specific injury. A dinner fork deformity is seen in a distal radius fracture, mallet finger is due to a disruption of the extensor tendon attachment, gun stock deformity refers to a deformity of the upper end of the ulna bone, and garden spade deformity is not a recognized medical term. Therefore, the most probable deformity in this scenario is gamekeeper's thumb due to the mechanism of injury and exam findings.",b,b,TRUE,
1461. a 25yo male had an injury to the knee while playing football. xr=condylar fx of tibia. what is the single most probable deformity?,a. dinner fork deformity,b. gibbus,c. cubitus valgus,d. garden spade deformity,e. genu valgus,,,,,,key: the key is e. genu valgus.,"The correct answer to this question is e. genu valgus. Genu valgus, commonly known as knock knees, is a medical condition whereby the legs angle inwards at the knee joint, resulting in a misalignment of the lower limbs. This condition is likely to occur in individuals who have suffered a condylar fracture of the tibia due to an injury sustained during physical activity. The other answer choices are incorrect because they describe deformities that are not associated with this particular type of fracture. The dinner fork deformity, for example, is typically associated with fractures of the distal radius, while gibbus is a spinal deformity characterized by a hunchback appearance. Cubitus valgus refers to an angle deformity of the elbow joint, while garden spade deformity is associated with fractures of the distal phalanx. Therefore, the most plausible deformity resulting from this injury is genu valgus.",e,e,TRUE,
"1462. a 50yo man presents with itching after hot shower with dizziness, chest pain after exercise. exam: splenomegaly. what is the single most likely causative factor?",a. all,b. lymphoma,c. polycythemia,d. scabies,e. eczema,,,,,,key: the key is c. polycythemia. [itching after hot shower; dizziness and angina due to hyperviscosity and splenomegaly are well known features of polycythemia].,"The single most likely causative factor for the 50-year-old man with itching after a hot shower, dizziness, chest pain after exercise, and splenomegaly is c. polycythemia. Polycythemia is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of red blood cells in the body, which can lead to thickening of the blood and difficulty in circulation. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness and chest pain due to hyperviscosity and reduced blood flow. Itching after a hot shower is also a well-known feature of polycythemia. The other answer choices, such as all, lymphoma, scabies, and eczema, are not relevant to the given symptoms and exam findings. Therefore, the correct answer is c. polycythemia.",c,c,TRUE,
1463. a man presented with carcinoma of the bladder and has been working in factories. he wants to know what dye has caused it. what is the single most likely cause?,a. aniline,b. asbestos,c. latex,d. silica,,,,,,,key: the key is a. aniline. [aniline dye is a well known cause of bladder cancer].,"The correct answer to the question of what dye has caused the bladder cancer in the man who has been working in factories is a. aniline. Aniline dye is a well known cause of bladder cancer, and has been linked to the disease in numerous studies. Asbestos (b), latex (c), and silica (d) are all also commonly linked to cancer, but not specifically bladder cancer, and therefore are not the most likely cause in this case. It is important for individuals who work in factory settings to be aware of the potential dangers associated with certain chemicals and compounds, and take proper precautions to protect their health.",a,a,TRUE,
1464. a 62yo man presents with left sided hearing loss and tinnitus. he also complains of vomiting and headache. exam: papilledema and snhl in the left ear. what is the single most likely dx?,a. meningioma,b. nasopharyngeal ca,c. acoustic neuroma,d. pharyngeal ca,e. meniere’s disease,,,,,,"key: the key is c. acoustic neuroma. [snhl, tinnitus, papilledema (raised intracranial pressure) are suggestive of acoustic neuroma].","Based on the symptoms presented, the single most likely diagnosis for the 62-year-old man is acoustic neuroma. SNHL, tinnitus, and papilledema (raised intracranial pressure) are all common symptoms associated with acoustic neuroma. This type of tumor affects the nerve responsible for hearing and balance and is often diagnosed through MRI scans. Meningioma, nasopharyngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, and Meniere's disease may also cause similar symptoms, but they are less likely given the specific presentation of papilledema and SNHL in the left ear. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, acoustic neuroma, while the other choices are less likely based on the presenting symptoms.",c,c,TRUE,
"1465. a hiv +ve 55yo man presents with painless lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats and weight loss. what is the most probable dx?",a. hodgkin’s lymphoma,b. nhl,c. all,d. aml,e. cml,,,,,,key: the key is b. nhl. [nhl is more likely diagnosis in aids or immunodeficient state].,"The most probable diagnosis for a 55-year-old HIV positive man presenting with painless lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, and weight loss is NHL (Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma). NHL is more likely to occur in individuals with AIDS or weakened immune systems. Hodgkin's lymphoma (A) is less likely given the lack of other characteristic symptoms such as itching after drinking alcohol. ALL (C), AML (D), and CML (E) are all types of leukemia and are less likely given the presentation of painless lymphadenopathy. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",b,b,TRUE,
1466. a 22yo man says that he can hear the voice of his deceased uncle telling him that he is being spied on. the pt is distressed by this becoming low in mood and anxious and has not left the house for 2wks. he is starting to drink increasing quantities of alcohol. he is noticed to have thought-block and passivity phenomena. what is the single most suitable med to treat his symptom?,a. diazepam,b. disulfiram,c. fluoxetine,d. lithium,e. olanzapine,,,,,,"key: the key is e. olanzapine. [auditory hallucination, social withdrawal, thought block are features of schizophrenia. so olanzapine is the drug to be prescribed from the given option].","The correct answer is e. Olanzapine. The patient is exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia, including auditory hallucinations, social withdrawal, and thought-blocking. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that can effectively treat these symptoms. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and is not effective for treating schizophrenia. Disulfiram is used to treat alcohol dependence, but is not effective for treating schizophrenia. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant used to treat depression and anxiety, but is not effective for treating schizophrenia. Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder, but is not effective for treating schizophrenia. Therefore, the most appropriate medication for this patient's symptoms is olanzapine.",e,e,TRUE,
1467.  a middle aged asian presents with episodes of fever with rigors and chills for last 1yr. blood film: ring form of plasmodium with schuffners dots in rbcs. what is the drug to eradicate this infection?,a. doxycycline,b. mefloquine,c. proguanil,d. quinine,e. artesunate,,,,,,key: the key is b. mefloquine which is a wrong key! none of the given options is correct!! [shuffners dot indicate either vivax or ovale infection and the hepatic cycle only can be eradicated by primaquine.  probably it is a bad recall].,"Based on the information you provided, it seems that the most appropriate drug to eradicate the infection in a middle-aged Asian person who presents with episodes of fever with rigors and chills for the last 1 year, with a blood film showing ring form of Plasmodium with Schuffner s dots in red blood cells, is artesunate. Artesunate is an antimalarial drug that is effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the most dangerous type of malaria parasite. It is often used in combination with other antimalarial drugs to treat severe malaria.",b,e,corrected,
"1468. a 50yo man presents with flight of ideas which are rambling and disinhibited. he is distractable, confused and overactive. what is the most likely dx?",a. dementia,b. mania,c. schizophrenia,d. psychosis,e. acute confusional state,,,,,,"key: the key is b. mania. [flight of ideas, dysinhibition, distractibility, confusion and overactivity are features of mania].","The correct answer is b. mania. Mania is a state of elevated and irritable mood associated with a range of symptoms, including flight of ideas, disinhibition, distractibility, confusion, and overactivity. These symptoms are consistent with the presentation of the 50-year-old man described in the question. Dementia and acute confusional state are unlikely given the presence of other symptoms such as flight of ideas and disinhibition. Schizophrenia and psychosis may also involve similar symptoms but are less likely at this age and without further information about the presence of delusions or hallucinations. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is mania.",b,b,TRUE,
"1469. a pt presents with a lid lag, bulging eyes, opthalmoplegia and thyroid bruit. what inv will you do?",a. tft,b. eye sight,c. tensilon test,d. us,e. fnac,,,,,,key: the key is tft. [tft should be done. why not fnac? thyrotoxicosis is benign and not malignant].,"The correct answer to this question is option A - TFT or thyroid function test. This is because the patient is presenting with symptoms that are suggestive of thyrotoxicosis, which is a condition where the thyroid gland produces an excess amount of thyroid hormone. TFT can help identify abnormal levels of thyroid hormones in the blood, which can confirm the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Options B, C, D and E are incorrect because eye sight testing, tensilon tests, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), respectively, cannot confirm or rule out the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Additionally, FNAC is not recommended as the first line investigation for thyrotoxicosis as it is usually a benign condition and not malignant. It is important to identify the correct investigation in order to initiate appropriate management for the patient's condition.",a,a,TRUE,
1470. a 30yo lady complaining of right ear deafness with decreased corneal reflex and past pointing. acoustic analysis shows snhl. what is the next most appropriate inv to do?,a. ct brain,b. ct acoustic canal,c. mri brain,d. mri acoustic canal,e. pet brain,,,,,,key: the key is mri brain. this is wrong key! correct key is d. mri acoustic canal.,"The correct key for this question is option D, MRI Acoustic Canal, not MRI Brain as incorrectly stated. Choosing the correct diagnostic test is important to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. In this case, the patient has symptoms of right ear deafness with decreased corneal reflex and past pointing, and the acoustic analysis shows sensorineural hearing loss. This suggests a potential underlying issue with the acoustic nerve, which is why an MRI of the acoustic canal is the most appropriate next investigation. Options A and C, CT Brain and MRI Brain respectively, are not as appropriate as they would not provide sufficient detail of the acoustic canal. Option B, CT Acoustic Canal, has limited sensitivity and is not the preferred imaging modality. Option E, PET Brain, is not relevant to the investigation of the patient's presenting symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate investigation to do next would be an MRI Acoustic Canal.",d,d,TRUE,
"1471. a 29yo woman who returned from egypt 2wks ago now presents with difficulty in breathing, chest pain, cough and purulent sputum with an episode of blood staining. she is on cocps. what is the most likely dx?",a. pulmonary embolism,b. pneumonia,c. lung abscess,d. pneumothorax,e. pulmonary edema,,,,,,key: the key is b. pneumonia. [purulent sputum is the clincher to differentiate pneumonia from pulmonary embolism here].,"The most likely diagnosis for the 29-year-old woman with difficulty breathing, chest pain, cough, and purulent sputum with an episode of blood staining, who recently returned from Egypt and is on COCPs, is b. pneumonia. This is because purulent sputum is a characteristic sign of pneumonia, which differentiates it from pulmonary embolism. The other choices, such as pulmonary embolism, lung abscess, pneumothorax, and pulmonary edema do not typically present with purulent sputum and do not have a clear association with a recent trip to Egypt or the use of COCPs. Therefore, pneumonia is the most probable diagnosis in this case, and immediate medical attention and treatment should be sought.",b,b,TRUE,
"1472. a 60yo pt recovering from a surgery for toxic goiter is found to be hypotensive, cyanosed in the recovery room. exam: neck is tense. there is oozing of blood from the drain. what is the most probable dx?",a. thyroid storm,b. reactionary hemorrhage,c. secondary hemorrhage,d. primary hemorrhage,e. tracheomalacia,,,,,,key: no key is given. correct key is b. reactionary hemorrhage. [hemorrhage within 1st 24 hours which usually occurs due to dislodgement of clot or slippage of a ligature].,"The correct answer is b. reactionary hemorrhage. This type of hemorrhage occurs within the first 24 hours after surgery, usually due to dislodgement of a clot or slippage of a ligature. In this case, the patient's symptoms of hypotension and cyanosis, along with oozing of blood from the drain and a tense neck, are all consistent with a reactionary hemorrhage. It is unlikely to be thyroid storm, as that would present with different symptoms such as fever and tachycardia. Secondary hemorrhage occurs after the first 24 hours and primary hemorrhage occurs during the surgery itself. Tracheomalacia is a separate condition unrelated to this case.",b,b,TRUE,
"1473. a 40yo woman has had varicose vein surgery, planned as a day pt. after the op, she is distressed by repeated retching and vomiting. her pain is currently well controlled. what is the best management strategy?",a. tramadol,b. co-codamol,c. im morphine,d. iv ondansetron,e. po ondansetron,,,,,,key: the key is d. iv ondensatron. [as there is repeated retching and vomiting pt. cannot keep oral medication down. so iv ondansatron].,"The correct answer is d, IV ondansetron. This is because the woman is experiencing repeated retching and vomiting after varicose vein surgery, which indicates that she may be experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). IV ondansetron is an appropriate medication in this case as it is effective in preventing and treating PONV. Tramadol and co-codamol are both pain medications, but they do not address the nausea and vomiting symptoms. IM morphine is another pain medication that is not effective in treating PONV. PO ondansetron may be recommended for PONV if the woman is able to keep oral medication down, but this is not the case in this scenario. Therefore, IV ondansetron is the best management strategy to treat the woman's nausea and vomiting.",d,d,TRUE,
"1474. a pt with renal failure has serum k+=7.5, raised creatinine and broad complex tachycardia. what is the most appropriate management?",a. calcium gluconate,b. sodium bicarbonate,c. dialysis,d. furosemide,e. sotalol,,,,,,key: the key is a. calcium gluconate. [calcium gluconate don’t shift k+ to cell or reduce potassium level but it prevents arrythmogenic action of raised k+ till definitive measure is taken].,"In a patient with renal failure presenting with a serum potassium level of 7.5, raised creatinine, and broad complex tachycardia, the most appropriate management is calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate does not shift potassium to the cell or reduce potassium levels, but it prevents the arrhythmogenic action of raised potassium until definitive measures can be taken. Options such as sodium bicarbonate, furosemide, and sotalol are not effective in immediately reducing potassium levels and may not address the underlying cause. Dialysis may be necessary in the long term, but calcium gluconate is the most appropriate immediate management to address the life-threatening arrhythmias associated with hyperkalemia.",a,a,TRUE,
"1475. an 18yo lady in her 30th wk of pregnancy is brought to the hospital in an altered sensorium. she is taking slow, shallow breaths and her breath has a fruity smell. an abg: ph=7.20, urine ketones: +ve. what is the most probable dx?",a. honk,b. dka,c. hellp syndrome,d. pih,e. gdm,,,,,,key: the key is b. dka. [shallow breath and fruity smell with acidosis in abg and positive ketone body in urine suggests the diagnosis of dka].,"The correct answer is b. dka. The presentation of an altered sensorium, shallow breathing, fruity breath odor, low pH on arterial blood gas, and positive ketones in urine are all indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This condition occurs when there is a shortage of insulin in the body, causing an increase in blood sugar, which the body cannot use for energy. As a result, the body starts to break down fats instead, producing ketone bodies as a byproduct. These ketones accumulate in the blood and can lead to metabolic acidosis, causing the symptoms seen in the patient. Honk (hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma) is a condition that occurs in older patients with type 2 diabetes and presents with extreme hyperglycemia, altered mental status, and dehydration without the presence of ketosis. HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) and PIH (pregnancy-induced hypertension) are conditions that occur in pregnant women, but they do not present with the symptoms seen in this patient. GDM (gestational diabetes mellitus) is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy, but it typically presents later in pregnancy and does not typically cause the symptoms seen in this patient. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis based on the patient's presentation is DKA.",b,b,TRUE,
1476. a 26yo man presented with abdomen distension and pain. his stools have been mucoid and sometimes blood stained. what is the most appropriate inv?,a. stool c&s,b. gastroscopy,c. igg tissue transglutaminase,d. barium meal,e. jejunal biopsy,,,,,,key: the key is d. barium meal. this is wrong key. correct key is a. stool c&s. [probable diagnosis is ulcerative colitis and abdominal distension may indicate toxic megacolon where barium enema should be avoided. stool assessment is one of the lab procedures done in ulcerative colitis which may be the option from given ones. stool culture is not confirmatory but suggestive].,"The most appropriate investigation for this 26-year-old man with abdomen distension and pain, and mucoid and sometimes blood stained stools, would be a stool culture and sensitivity (C&S) test (option A). This is because these symptoms are indicative of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon. Stool assessment is one of the laboratory procedures done in ulcerative colitis, which makes it a suitable option from the given choices. Gastroscopy (option B) and tissue transglutaminase (option C) are not relevant in this case, as they are used to diagnose different conditions. Furthermore, barium meal (option D) should be avoided if the patient has toxic megacolon, which could be the case with this patient's symptoms. Jejunal biopsy (option E) would be unnecessary in this situation, as the symptoms point to a problem in the colon. Therefore, option A, stool C&S, would be the most appropriate investigation to confirm a probable diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.",a,a,TRUE,
"1477. an 83yo elderly woman presented in the ed with cough, fever and sneezing. tx was given but she became confused and again presented with above said symptoms. what is the cause of her condition?",a. aspiration due to confusion,b. alveolar damage due to drugs,c. drug toxicity,d. pneumothorax,,,,,,,key: the key is a. aspiration due to confusion.,"The correct answer is a. Aspiration due to confusion. Aspiration occurs when food, liquids, or other substances are inhaled into the lungs instead of being swallowed into the stomach. It often occurs in elderly patients who have difficulty swallowing or are confused and have an impaired gag reflex. In this case, the elderly woman's confusion likely contributed to her inhaling something she was trying to swallow, leading to aspiration and subsequent respiratory symptoms. Choices b, c, and d are not correct in this case, as they do not explain the specific symptoms presented by the patient and are not likely causes of her condition.",a,a,TRUE,
1478. a 37yo man presents with some raised lesions on the shin. he came with cough and also complains of arthralgia. exam: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and erythema nodosum is present. what is the single most likely cause?,a. cd,b. uc,c. sarcoidosis,d. streptococcal infection,e. tb,,,,,,"key: the key is b. uc. it is a wrong key! correct key is c. sarcoidosis. [cough, arthralgia, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and erythema nodosum are suggestive of sarcoidosis].","The most likely cause for a 37-year-old man presenting with raised lesions on his shin, cough, arthralgia, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and erythema nodosum is sarcoidosis. The key diagnostic features of cough, arthralgia, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and erythema nodosum are suggestive of sarcoidosis, making it the most probable diagnosis. The incorrect answer choices are a streptococcal infection, tuberculosis, and UC and CD, which are not associated with the characteristic symptoms and clinical findings of the patient. Therefore, sarcoidosis is the single most likely cause based on the patient's presenting symptoms and examination findings.",c,c,TRUE,
1479. a young lady with cervical ectropion bleeds on touch. what is the most appropriate next inv?,a. transvaginal us,b. cervical smear,c. punch biopsy,d. serum estradiol,e. colposcopy,,,,,,key: b. cervical smear. wrong key! correct key is e. colposcopy.[screening test cervical smear is only done in scheduled time and not in on demand basis. so if it is scheduled now then it can be the option otherwise colposcopy should be the key!! this is definitely an incomplete question].,"The most appropriate next investigation for a young lady with cervical ectropion who bleeds upon touch is e. colposcopy. This is because cervical ectropion is a common finding in young, sexually active women, and is typically a benign condition. However, in rare cases, it may be associated with premalignant or malignant changes. Colposcopy, which involves examining the cervix under magnification and with the use of a special dye, can help the clinician identify any abnormal areas in the cervix and obtain biopsy samples if necessary. Transvaginal ultrasound (a) is typically not useful in evaluating cervical ectropion, as it primarily assesses the uterus and ovaries. Cervical smear (b) is a screening test that is typically done on a scheduled basis, not in response to a specific symptom or finding. Punch biopsy (c) may be necessary if colposcopy reveals an abnormal area, but is not a first-line investigation. Serum estradiol (d) is not typically useful in evaluating cervical ectropion or associated bleeding. It is important to note that the original question was incomplete, as it did not provide context regarding why a screening test (cervical smear) was being considered in this case.",e,e,TRUE,
1480. a 28yo man with recent onset of dyspepsia after eating spicy food and alcohol consumption. h. pylori fecal antigen was negative. he returns after 1m with similar symptoms despite being given omeprazole 40mg. what is the single best initial inv?,a. hydrogen breath test,b. gastroscopy,c. barium meal,d. none,,,,,,,key: the key is b. gastroscopy.,"The correct answer for the single best initial investigation for a 28-year-old man with recent onset of dyspepsia after eating spicy food and alcohol consumption and negative H. pylori fecal antigen despite being given omeprazole 40mg is b. Gastroscopy. This is because, despite negative H. pylori fecal antigen, an endoscopy can identify other causes of dyspepsia, such as acid reflux, gastric ulcers, and gastritis. Hydrogen breath test and barium meal are not the best initial investigations for dyspepsia, as they are less sensitive and specific than gastroscopy for identifying underlying causes of the symptoms. The option ""none"" is not a valid answer as the patient's symptoms require further investigation to identify and treat any underlying conditions.",b,b,TRUE,
"1481. a 35yo woman who usually has 4 days mid-cycle bleeding, had her period 10d ago. she has now presented with spots of blood. her smear was normal 6m ago. exam: cervical ectropion which doesn’t bleed on touch. what would you do?",a. cervical smear,b. endocervical swab,c. us guided biopsy,d. laparotomy,e. transvaginal us,f. punch biopsy,g. serum estradiol,h. colposcopy,,,key: the key is a. cervical smear. wrong key! correct key is endocervical swab. [cervical smear can only be done on scheduled time and not in on need basis. in given case for intermenstrual bleeding endocervical swab should be done].,"In this scenario, the correct answer would be b. endocervical swab. This is because the patient is experiencing intermenstrual bleeding and her smear was normal 6 months ago. A cervical smear can only be done on a scheduled basis and is not appropriate for this situation. Endocervical swabbing would be the best option to collect a sample of cervical cells and check for any abnormalities or infections that may be causing the bleeding. The other options such as us guided biopsy, laparotomy, transvaginal us, punch biopsy, serum estradiol, and colposcopy are not indicated for this specific scenario and may be unnecessary interventions.",b,b,TRUE,
"1482. a 7yo boy presents with epistaxis of 2h duration. the bleeding has been controlled. inv: plts=210, pt=13, aptt=42, bleeding time=normal. which of the following is the most likely dx?",a. hemophilia,b. von willebrand disease,c. itp,d. vit k deficiency,e. liver disease,f. anatomical defect,,,,,key: the key is f. anatomical defect.,"The correct answer is f, anatomical defect. This boy presents with isolated epistaxis, or nosebleed, which can occur due to a variety of reasons, including trauma, infections, allergies, dry air, and anatomical defects. His laboratory results are all within normal ranges except for a mildly prolonged PT, which suggests a mild deficiency in clotting factor VII, but not enough to cause significant bleeding. Hemophilia and von Willebrand disease are disorders that cause significant bleeding with minor trauma and would be unlikely in the setting of normal bleeding time and a mildly prolonged PT. ITP, or immune thrombocytopenic purpura, causes low platelet counts and spontaneous bleeding, and would not present with isolated epistaxis. Vit K deficiency and liver disease can cause bleeding due to low levels of clotting factors, but the bleeding time would be prolonged in both of those conditions, which is not the case in this patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this 7-year-old boy with controlled epistaxis, normal bleeding time, and mildly prolonged PT is an anatomical defect.",f,f,TRUE,
"1483. a pregnant woman returns from sudan, now presenting with intermittent fever, rigor and seizures. what is the dx?",a. tb,b. malaria,c. meningitis,d. lyme disease,,,,,,,key: the key is b. malaria. [intermittent fever is seen in malaria. in meningitis fever is not intermittent].,"The correct answer is B, malaria. Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that causes intermittent fever, characterized by episodes of high fever, followed by periods of sweating and chills. In this scenario, the pregnant woman has returned from Sudan, which is known to have a high incidence of malaria. Additionally, the presence of seizures is consistent with severe malaria, which can lead to cerebral complications. The other answer choices are unlikely because TB would not present with intermittent fever, meningitis does not cause rigor, and Lyme disease is not commonly seen in Sudan. Therefore, B, malaria, is the most probable diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,
1484. a pt is unresponsive and cyanosed. what is the most definitive 1st step in management?,a. chest compressions,b. check airway,c. call 999,d. mouth to mouth,e. recovery position,,,,,,key: the key is b. check airway.,"The correct answer for this scenario is b, to check the airway. In an unresponsive and cyanosed patient, the priority is to ensure that the airway is clear and unobstructed. Chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth are interventions that are done as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which is indicated if the patient has absent or ineffective breathing and pulse. However, before initiating CPR, it is crucial to assess and clear the airway. Calling 999 and placing the patient in a recovery position are also important steps in management, but they should come after securing the airway or starting CPR if necessary. Therefore, the most definitive 1st step in managing an unresponsive and cyanosed patient would be to check the airway.",b,b,TRUE,
1485. a man was bitten by a drug addict and comes to the hosp with a wound. what inv should be undertaken?,a. hep c,b. lyme disease,c. hep b,d. syphilis,e. hep a,,,,,,key: the key is c. hepatitis b.,"The correct answer to the question is Hepatitis B (option C). This is because Hepatitis B is a blood-borne viral infection that can be contracted through contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood. As the man was bitten by a drug addict, there is a possibility that he may have been exposed to the virus. Hence, testing for Hepatitis B is crucial in such a scenario. The other options listed, such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and Hepatitis A are unlikely to be contracted through a bite wound. Therefore, testing for these conditions would not be necessary in this case. The option listed as ""nan"" is incorrect and should be ignored as it does not provide any meaningful information.",c,c,TRUE,
1486. an 18yo woman says that she can’t walk around as she is very big for that room. what is the most likely hallucination?,a. extracampine visual hallucinations,b. liliputian visual hallucinations,c. alice in wonderland syndrome,d. hypnagogic hallucinations,,,,,,,key: the key is b. lilliputian visual hallucination.  [b. liliputian visual hallucinations and c. alice in wonderland syndrome are same].,"The correct answer is b. Liliputian visual hallucinations. Liliputian visual hallucinations refer to the perception of objects, usually people, animals or plants, as smaller than their actual size. This phenomenon is often reported in patients with migraines or epilepsy, and can be caused by abnormal activity in the visual cortex. Extracampine visual hallucinations refer to the perception of objects that are outside of the visual field, while hypnagogic hallucinations occur when falling asleep or waking up. Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is a subtype of liliputian visual hallucination, in which objects may be perceived as larger or smaller than their actual size. However, in this case, the patient reports feeling too big for the room which indicates a size distortion in self-perception, which is characteristic of liliputian visual hallucinations.",b,b,TRUE,
"1487. a middle aged lady presented with fever, altered sensorium, bleeding gums and jaundice. labs: deranged renal function tests, normal pt/aptt, fragmented rbcs and low plts. what’s the most likely dx?",a. cholesterol emboli,b. hus,c. ttp,d. hepatorenal syndrome,e. sepsis,,,,,,key: the key is c. ttp. [fever and altered sensorium suggest the diagnosis of ttp].,"Based on the given presentation of fever, altered sensorium, bleeding gums, jaundice, deranged renal function tests, fragmented red blood cells, and low platelets, the most likely diagnosis is TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). The key clue here is the presence of fragmented red blood cells, which is a characteristic feature of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) seen in TTP. The other options are less likely: cholesterol emboli usually present with skin lesions, HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome) is more common in children and is usually associated with diarrhea, hepatorenal syndrome is seen in patients with advanced liver disease, and sepsis typically presents with fever, hypotension, and organ dysfunction. Therefore, the correct answer is C (TTP).",c,c,TRUE,
1488. a child came to the ed with severe asthma and not responding to salbutamol nebulizer and vomiting many times. what is the most appropriate management?,a. salmetrol,b. montelukast,c. prednisolone,d. budesonide inhaler,e. oxygen,f. iv salbutamol,,,,,key: the key is a. salmeterol which is a wrong key!! the correct option is f. iv salbutamol. [in acute attack there is no place for salmeterol. in the given case most appropriate management is iv salbutamol].,"The most appropriate management for a child with severe asthma who is not responding to salbutamol nebulizer and vomiting many times would be f. IV salbutamol. This is because in an acute attack, there is no place for maintenance medications like salmeterol or montelukast. Additionally, using an inhaler like budesonide may be difficult for a child who is vomiting. Oxygen can help improve oxygen saturation, but it does not address the underlying cause of the asthma attack. Therefore, IV salbutamol is the most appropriate option as it provides fast-acting relief to relieve bronchospasm, maintain airway patency, and improve ventilation. Prednisolone may also be used as an adjunctive therapy to manage inflammation and prevent relapse.",f,f,TRUE,
"1489. a 73yo woman with skeletal and brain mets from breast ca has worsening low back pain and blurring of vision. she has weakness of her legs, minimal knee and absent ankle tendon reflexes, a palpable bladder, a power of 2/5 at the hip, 3/5 at the knee and ankle, and tenderness over the 2nd lumbar vertebra. there is reduced sensation in the perineum. she has been started on dexamethasone 16mg daily.what is the single most likely cause of her weakness?",a. paraneoplastic neuropathy,b. progression of brain tumor,c. pid at l2/l3,d. spinal cord compression,e. steroid induced myopathy,,,,,,key: no key is given! the likely correct option is d. spinal cord compression. [brain metastasis induced cerebral oedema can explain blurring of vision secondary to raised intracranial pressure. rest of the features including weakness can well explain spinal cord compression].,"Based on the given information, the most likely cause of the patient's weakness is d. spinal cord compression. This is supported by the patient's symptoms of worsening low back pain, weakness of the legs, absent ankle tendon reflexes, and reduced sensation in the perineum. The blurring of vision can be explained by brain metastasis induced cerebral edema causing raised intracranial pressure. The fact that the patient has been started on dexamethasone further supports this diagnosis, as it is a common treatment for spinal cord compression. Paraneoplastic neuropathy and steroid-induced myopathy are less likely causes, as they do not fully explain the constellation of the patient's symptoms. Progression of brain tumor and PID at L2/L3 are also unlikely causes, as neither fully explains the patient's weakness.",d,d,TRUE,
1490. a 78yo woman presents with unilateral headache and pain on chewing. esr=70mm/hr. she is on oral steroids. what is the appropriate additional therapy?,a. bisphosphonates,b. hrt,c. acei,d. ifn,e. iv steroids,,,,,,key: the key is a. bisphosphonates. [oral steroid can lead to decrease in bone mineral density. to overcome this bisphosphonate can be administered].,"The appropriate additional therapy for a 78-year-old woman who presents with unilateral headache and pain on chewing, has an ESR of 70mm/hr, and is on oral steroids, is A) bisphosphonates. Oral steroids can lead to a decrease in bone mineral density, which can result in osteoporosis and fractures. Bisphosphonates can help to prevent bone loss and fractures in patients who are taking oral steroids. HRT (answer B) is not indicated in this case as the patient's age puts her at risk for breast cancer, heart disease, and other adverse effects associated with HRT. ACE inhibitors (answer C) are used to treat hypertension and heart failure, and are not indicated in this case. IFN (answer D) is used to treat viral infections and certain cancers, and is not indicated in this case. IV steroids (answer E) are already being used by the patient, and adding more steroids could potentially worsen her bone loss. Therefore, the appropriate additional therapy in this case is bisphosphonates.",a,a,TRUE,
1491. a 48yo woman is admitted to the ed with a productive cough and mod fever. she often has central chest pain and she regurgitates undigested food most of the time but doesn’t suffer from acid reflux. these symptoms have been present for the last 3.5m which affects her daily food intake. cxr: air-fluid level behind a normal sized heart. what is the single most likely dx?,a. pharyngeal pouch,b. hiatus hernia,c. bulbar palsy,d. achalasia,e. tb,,,,,,key: 1. the key is b. hiatus hernia. [usually in hiatus hernia there is acid reflux but in given case there is no acid reflux which can be true if hiatus hernia is small].,"Based on the given symptoms and the findings from the chest X-ray, the single most likely diagnosis for the 48-year-old woman is a hiatus hernia, represented by key 1B. Hiatus hernia is characterized by the protrusion of part of the stomach through the diaphragm into the chest, causing symptoms such as regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain, and difficulties with food intake. Acid reflux is a common symptom of hiatus hernia, but it may not always be present, especially in cases where the hernia is small. The other choices, pharyngeal pouch, bulbar palsy, achalasia, and tuberculosis, are less likely to explain the given symptoms and the air-fluid level observed in the chest X-ray. A pharyngeal pouch refers to a herniation of the pharyngeal mucosa, causing dysphagia and regurgitation of undigested food, but it usually affects older adults and is associated with a history of throat irritation. Bulbar palsy is a neurological condition that affects the ability to swallow and speak, but it typically presents with muscle weakness and paralysis of the tongue and throat. Achalasia refers to a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax during swallowing, leading to dysphagia and chest pain, but it is rarely associated with regurgitation of undigested food. Finally, tuberculosis is an infectious disease that may cause fever, cough, and chest pain, but it is not likely to explain the observed air-fluid level and the chronic nature of the symptoms. Therefore, the best choice among the given options is hiatus hernia.",b,b,TRUE,
1492. a retired ship worker has pleural effusion and pleural thickening on right side with bilateral lung shadowing. what would you do to improve his symptoms?,a. aspiration,b. chest drain,c. chemotherapy,d. diuretic,,,,,,,key: the key is c. chemotherapy. it is a wrong key! correct key is b. chest drain. [response to chemotherapy and life expectancy is poor in mesothelioma. to improve symptoms chest drain should be undertaken].,"The correct answer to this question is B, chest drain. As the retired ship worker has pleural effusion and pleural thickening on the right side with bilateral lung shadowing, it is essential to undertake an appropriate intervention to improve his symptoms. While chemotherapy may be a potential treatment option, it is not the immediate solution as the response to chemotherapy and life expectancy is generally poor in cases of mesothelioma, which is often the underlying cause of this condition. Aspiration may provide temporary relief, but it is not a permanent solution. Diuretics are not recommended for treating pleural effusion as they are effective only in treating cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a condition that causes lung fluid buildup due to heart failure. In contrast, chest drain is the most effective solution in such a case as it helps to relieve the pressure and accumulated fluid in the pleural cavity, thereby improving the patient's symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
1493. an 88yo woman is a known smoker. she had an attack of mi 2y back and is known to have peripheral vascular disease. she presents with an irreducible herniation over the incision region of a surgery which she underwent in her childhood. what is the most appropriate tx?,a. truss,b. elective herniorrhaphy,c. urgent herniorrhaphy,d. elective herniotomy,e. reassure,,,,,,key: the key is b. elective hernioraphy. [truss can not be used as hernia is irreducible; urgent herniorrhaphy in strangulation; elective herniotomy- in herniotomy the hernia may recur; only reassure is not an option as irreducibe hernia may become strangulated or may develop intestinal obstruction].,"The most appropriate treatment for an 88-year-old woman with an irreducible herniation over the incision region of a surgery she underwent in her childhood, who is a known smoker and has peripheral vascular disease and had a previous MI, is elective herniorrhaphy. Truss cannot be used as the hernia is irreducible, urgent herniorrhaphy is indicated only in strangulation, elective herniotomy has a higher risk of hernia recurrence and reassure is not an option as an irreducible hernia may become strangulated or may develop intestinal obstruction. Therefore, elective herniorrhaphy is the most appropriate option to treat the patient's hernia, taking into account her age and medical history.",b,b,TRUE,
1494. a 72yo woman who is taking loop diuretics for left ventricular failure. she now is suffering from palpitations and muscle weakness. what is the electrolyte imbalance found?,"a. na+=130mmol/l, k+=2.5mmol/l","b. na+=130mmol/l, k+=5.5mmol/l","c. na+=140mmol/l, k+=4.5mmol/l","d. na+=150mmol/l, k+=3.5mmol/l",e. none,,,,,,"key: the key is a. na+=130mmol/l, k+=2.5mmol/l. [loop diuretics causes hyponatremia and hypokalemia].","The correct answer to the question is A. In this scenario, the woman is taking loop diuretics, which are known to cause hyponatremia and hypokalemia due to increased excretion of sodium and potassium ions. The electrolyte imbalance found demonstrates low levels of sodium (130 mmol/l) and slightly low levels of potassium (2.5 mmol/l). Option B is incorrect as it shows a higher potassium level than expected, while options C and D show normal to high levels of sodium, which is not consistent with loop diuretic therapy. Option E is also incorrect as it indicates that there is no identifiable electrolyte imbalance. It is crucial to recognize the correct electrolyte imbalances in this case to provide appropriate treatment and ensure patient safety.",a,a,TRUE,
"1495. a young woman who is a marathon runner comes with secondary amenorrhea. inv: normal lh, fsh and estradiol, prolactin=600. what is the most likely dx?",a. hypothalamic amenorrhea,b. pregnancy,c. pcos,d. prolactinoma,e. anorexia,,,,,,"key: the key is d. prolactinoma. it is a wrong key. correct key is a. hypothalamic amenorrhea. [generally in hypothalamic amenorrhea there is slight low level of lh, fsh and oestrogen and mild elavation of prolactin].","The correct answer to this question is A, hypothalamic amenorrhea. This is because the patient is a marathon runner, which can lead to alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and result in hypothalamic amenorrhea. The normal levels of LH, FSH, and estradiol support this diagnosis, as they are not typically affected in this condition. While the prolactin level is elevated, it is only mildly so and not at a level commonly seen in prolactinomas. The patient is not pregnant, so option B is not correct. PCOS (option C) typically presents with elevated levels of LH, FSH, and androgens, which is not seen in this patient. Anorexia (option E) can also lead to hypothalamic amenorrhea, but this diagnosis is not supported by the patient's history. Therefore, the best answer is A, hypothalamic amenorrhea.",a,a,TRUE,
1496. a 4yo child comes with a sprain in his foot. hx reveals that the child has had recurrent admissions to the hosp due to severe asthma. what is the most appropriate analgesic?,a. diclofenac sodium,b. ibuprofen,c. paracetamol,d. codeine,,,,,,,key: the key is c. paracetamol.,"In this scenario, the most appropriate analgesic for the 4-year-old child with a sprained foot who has a history of recurrent hospital admissions due to severe asthma is paracetamol (c). Paracetamol is a pain reliever that is effective in treating mild to moderate pain and has a lower risk of causing adverse effects in individuals with respiratory conditions like asthma when compared to other options like diclofenac sodium (a), ibuprofen (b), or codeine (d). Diclofenac and ibuprofen can potentially cause asthma exacerbations in some individuals, while codeine is not recommended for children under the age of 12 due to the risk of respiratory depression and other adverse effects. Therefore, paracetamol is the most appropriate choice for pain relief in this scenario.",c,c,TRUE,
"1497. a 34yo pregnant woman, 38wk ga is in labor. she had a long 1st stage and troublesome 2nd stage, has delivered a baby. after her placenta was delivered she had a convulsion. what is the most probable management?",a. mgso4 iv,b. diazepam iv,c. iv fluid,d. hydralazine iv,e. anti-epileptic,,,,,,"key: the key is a. mgso4 iv. [eclampsia, tx is iv mgso4].","The correct answer for the management of a 34-year-old pregnant woman who has had a convulsion after delivering a baby is a. mgso4 iv. This is because eclampsia, which is characterized by convulsions in pregnant women with hypertension, is a medical emergency and can be fatal if untreated. Mgso4 is the preferred treatment for eclampsia as it is a potent anticonvulsant that prevents further seizures and reduces the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Diazepam, on the other hand, is not recommended for the treatment of eclampsia as it has a slower onset of action, a shorter duration of action, and can cause respiratory depression. IV fluids are important in maintaining the fluid balance but they do not treat the underlying cause of the convulsion. Hydralazine IV may be used to treat hypertension, which is a risk factor for eclampsia, but it does not treat the convulsion. Anti-epileptic medications are not the preferred treatment for eclampsia and may be contraindicated in pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient would be to administer Mgso4 IV to prevent further seizures and manage the underlying condition of eclampsia.",a,a,TRUE,
1498. a 23yo woman presents with offensive vaginal discharge. vaginal ph=4.5. what is the most likely organism?,a. gardenella,b. trichomonas,c. candida,d. mycoplasma,,,,,,,key: the key is a. gardenella.,"In this scenario, the most probable organism causing the offensive vaginal discharge in the 23-year-old woman is Gardenella, making option A the correct answer. Gardenella is a bacterium that can cause bacterial vaginosis, which is characterized by a thin, white-gray discharge with a foul odor. An important clue to suspect Gardenella as the cause is the vaginal pH of 4.5, which is higher than normal and an indication of bacterial vaginosis. Trichomonas and Candida are other possible causes of vaginal infections, but they usually present with different symptoms and have different pH levels. Mycoplasma is not a common cause of vaginal infections, so option D is incorrect. In conclusion, based on the given information, Gardenella is the most likely organism causing the woman's symptoms and should be treated appropriately.",a,a,TRUE,
"1499. a 62yo man has had ano-rectal pain aggravated by defecation for 3d. rectal exam: purple, tender lump at the anal verge. flexible aigmoidoscopy: normal rectal mucosa and hard feces. what is the best management strategy?",a. anal hematoma,b. anal fissure,c. rectal ca,d. diverticulitis,e. angiodysplasia,,,,,,key: the key is a. anal hematoma.,"The correct answer is a: anal hematoma. An anal hematoma is a collection of blood in the anal region that forms a lump and causes pain. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest an anal hematoma. Anal fissures typically cause sharp pain during bowel movement and have a visible tear in the anal mucosa. Rectal cancer would not present with a tender lump at the anal verge and would require further testing, like a biopsy or imaging studies, for diagnosis. Diverticulitis is inflammation of pockets that form in the colon and would have symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel movement. Angiodysplasia refers to abnormal blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract and would not cause a lump or tenderness. In summary, anal hematoma is the best management strategy given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.",a,a,TRUE,
1500. a 43yo presents with severe vertigo on moving sidewards whilst sleeping. what test would you do to confirm the dx?,a. hallpikes maneovure,b. romberg’s test,c. trendelenburg test,d. heel-shin test,,,,,,,key: the key is a. hallpike maneovure. [hallpike maneovure is the preferred method to detect benign positional vertigo].,"The correct answer is a. Hallpike's manoeuvre. This test involves the patient sitting on the edge of the exam table with the head turned 45 degrees to one side, and then being rapidly laid down on their back with the head hanging slightly off the edge. The test is positive if there is a rapid onset of vertigo and associated nystagmus (abnormal eye movements) that lasts for up to one minute. This is indicative of benign positional vertigo (BPV), which is a common cause of vertigo.

The other choices are not appropriate for this scenario. Romberg's test assesses balance and is not specific for diagnosing BPV. Trendelenburg's test assesses the function of the hip and is not related to vertigo. The heel-shin test assesses the function of the lower extremities and is not useful in diagnosing BPV. In conclusion, Hallpike's manoeuvre is the preferred method to detect benign positional vertigo and is the correct answer for this clinical scenario.",a,a,TRUE,
"1501. a 23yo man is having difficulty in speaking following a stab wound to the right of his neck. on being asked to protrude his tongue, the tip deviated to the right. which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?",a. facial nerve,b. hypoglossal nerve,c. vagus nerve,d. trigeminal nerve,e. glossopharyngeal nerve,,,,,,"key: the key is b. hypoglossal nerve. [in hypoglossal nerve palsy  the tongue will be curved toward the damaged side, combined with the presence of fasciculations or atrophy of tongue on same side].","Based on the presentation of this patient, the most likely anatomical site affected is the hypoglossal nerve, indicated by answer choice B. The hypoglossal nerve controls the muscles of the tongue, and damage to this nerve can result in deviation of the tongue towards the side of the damage, as observed in this patient's protrusion of the tongue. Answer choices A (facial nerve), C (vagus nerve), D (trigeminal nerve), and E (glossopharyngeal nerve) are all unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms as they do not directly innervate the tongue muscles. Therefore, the correct answer is B because it is the only anatomical site that fits the observed presentation.",b,b,TRUE,
1502. a girl presents with signs of hyperventilation. what is the most likely abg derangement?,"a. ph increased, pco2 increased","b. ph decreased, pco2 increased","c. ph increased, pco2 decreased","d. ph decreased, pco2 decreased",,,,,,,"key: the key is a. ph increased, pco2 increased. this is a wrong key. correct key should be c. ph increased, pco2 decreased.","The correct answer to the question is c. ph increased and pco2 decreased. When a person is hyperventilating, they are breathing too quickly and eliminating too much carbon dioxide from their body. This causes a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream and leads to respiratory alkalosis, where the pH of the blood increases. Option a is incorrect because an increase in pco2 would actually cause a decrease in pH, leading to respiratory acidosis. Option b is incorrect because both the pH and pco2 would decrease in respiratory acidosis. Option d is also incorrect because both the pH and pco2 would decrease in metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the correct answer is c, with an increased pH due to respiratory alkalosis and a decreased pco2 due to hyperventilation.",c,c,TRUE,
"1503. a pt presents with skin pigmentation, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and postural hypotension. what electrolyte abnormality is likely to occur?","a. na+=130, k+=6.5","b. na+=130, k+=2.5","c. na+=13, k+=6.0","d. na+=140, k+=8","e. na+=130, k+=1.5",,,,,,"key: the key is a. na+=130, k+=6.5. [in addison’s disease there is low na+, low cl-, low co2 and raised k+].","The symptoms you described, including skin pigmentation, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and postural hypotension, are consistent with Addison s disease1. Addison s disease is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands that results in a deficiency of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone1. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly low sodium (hyponatremia) and high potassium (hyperkalemia)2. Based on the options you provided, the most likely electrolyte abnormality to occur in this case would be sodium of 130 mEq/L and potassium of 6.5 mEq/L.",a,a,TRUE,
1504. a 10yo boy develops nasal bleeding. what is the best way to stop the bleeding from the nose?,a. pressure over base of the nose,b. ice packs,c. pressure over the soft tissues,d. nasal packing,e. surgery,,,,,,key: the key is c. pressure over the soft tissues.,"The correct answer is C, pressure over the soft tissues. The most effective way to stop nasal bleeding is by gently pinching the soft part of the nose, just below the bridge. This puts pressure on the blood vessels inside the nose, helping to reduce bleeding. Applying ice packs can help to reduce swelling and provide some pain relief but it will not help to stop the bleeding. Nasal packing and surgery are more invasive measures that are usually reserved for cases of severe or persistent bleeding. Therefore, C is the best answer as it is a simple and effective first-line treatment, while the other choices are either not as effective or too invasive.",c,c,TRUE,

LMWH (low molecular weight heparin). While aspirin is an important medication for preventing clot formation, LMWH is vital in preventing further events or deterioration in this patient. Simvastatin is not the correct key, as it is a cholesterol-lowering medication and does not address the acute issue at hand. GTN (glyceryl trinitrate) may help alleviate the chest pain, but it is not the most specific treatment for the underlying condition. Clopidogrel and beta-blockers may be useful in certain situations, but LMWH is the most specific drug in this given scenario as it can help prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of complications.",e,e,TRUE,

This is because the patient had a similar episode 3 years ago, which suggests the possibility of a recurrent H. pylori infection. Serum H. pylori antibodies (option C) are not reliable for recheck as they persist for a long time, and upper GI endoscopy (option E) may not be necessary at this stage. Abdomen ultrasound (option A) and barium meal (option B) are not the most appropriate choices for investigating H. pylori infection.

Pleomorphic adenoma presents with a firm consistency, not a soft and cystic gland. Carcinoma of the salivary glands would present differently, with symptoms such as facial nerve weakness, numbness, and pain. Mikuliczas disease, also known as Sjogren's Syndrome, would typically present with bilateral parotid swelling and dryness of the eyes and mouth. Parotid duct stones would present with painful swelling and tenderness due to obstruction of the duct. Adenoid cystic carcinoma progresses slowly, and a 15-year cervical rate of 40% makes it the most probable diagnosis in this case.",d,d,TRUE,

This is due to the presence of a lucid interval, which is a characteristic feature of SAH. Also, extrdural hematomas are very rare in elderly individuals, and their features do not match those of meningitis.

This is because the patient presents with typical symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as involuntary writhing movements and a strong family history of similar complaints. The other options are unlikely diagnoses based on the given information. Pic's dementia (A) is a rare neurological disorder and typically presents with symptoms such as personality changes, rather than motor issues. Wilson's disease (B) may present with neurological symptoms, but typically involves liver and psychiatric symptoms as well. HIV-associated dementia (D) typically presents with more prominent cognitive impairment, such as memory problems, rather than motor symptoms. Fronto-temporal dementia (E) is another possible diagnosis, but it typically presents with personality changes, language deficits, and frontal lobe dysfunction, rather than motor symptoms.

BMJ is a type of neonatal jaundice associated with breastfeeding, which is characterized by indirect hyperbilirubinemia that presents in the first or second week of life and can persist for as long as 12 weeks before resolving spontaneously. In contrast, galactosemia presents with lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Thalassemia, sickle cell disease, and congenital storage disorders typically cause hemolytic jaundice, which is characterized by direct hyperbilirubinemia.

The HIV virus attacks the immune system, including the brain, leading to a condition known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which can present with symptoms such as memory problems, irritability, and difficulty with speech. The patient being on anti-tuberculosis treatment does not necessarily rule out HIV as a possible cause of her symptoms. The other options such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, drug toxicity, vascular dementia, and space-occupying lesion, have not been strongly linked to the patient's medical history or symptoms.

This is because the young girl is nulliparous and has menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. Mirena coil is usually given to women who have had at least one child. Copper T is a non-hormonal contraceptive that does not address the menstrual issues the girl is experiencing. UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization) is a procedure to treat fibroids and does not provide contraception. Depo Provera is a hormonal contraceptive that can worsen menstrual symptoms in some women. Therefore, COCP is the most appropriate choice as it can effectively manage the girl's menstrual symptoms while providing contraception.",a,a,TRUE,

MRI can provide a detailed image of the affected area, helping the clinician to identify the extent of the damage caused by the abscess and the presence of any associated complications. X-ray imaging may not be sensitive enough to detect soft tissue damage, while ultrasound may not provide enough detail for complex cases. Although CT can provide detailed cross-sectional images, it exposes the patient to radiation. Blood cultures are valuable but do not directly help in the diagnosis of a spinal abscess. Therefore, MRI is the best option and can guide further treatment decisions.",d,d,TRUE,

These symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. The sweat chloride test is a diagnostic test that measures the amount of salt in sweat, as individuals with cystic fibrosis have higher than normal levels of salt in their sweat.

This is because the symptoms presented by the patient, namely hemiplegia, homonymous hemianopia, and dysphasia, are common features of a stroke caused by a blockage or bleeding within the mid cerebral artery. The other choices - ant cerebral artery, post cerebral artery, internal carotid artery, and post inf cerebellar artery - are less likely to be involved in this particular case, as they usually present with different sets of symptoms. Therefore, the mid cerebral artery is the most likely vessel to be involved in this patient's stroke.",b,b,TRUE,

In SIADH, there is an excess secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to an increase in water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in a decrease in plasma sodium levels, as water dilutes the sodium concentration. Additionally, the increase in water reabsorption leads to an increase in urine osmolarity, as more solutes are concentrated in the smaller volume of urine. Option b is incorrect because urine osmolarity would not decrease in SIADH, as excess water reabsorption leads to more concentrated urine. Option c is incorrect because there is a decrease in plasma sodium levels in SIADH, not an increase. Option d is also incorrect as both plasma sodium levels and urine osmolarity would not increase in SIADH.",a,a,TRUE,

This condition is a congenital defect that occurs when the diaphragm muscle fails to develop properly, leading to an opening in the diaphragm. This opening allows organs from the abdomen, such as the liver, spleen, and intestines, to move into the chest cavity and compress the lungs, leading to respiratory distress. Elective intubation and surgery 48 hours after birth are common treatments for this condition. Options A, C, D, and E are all incorrect because they do not present with the same symptoms or require the same treatment. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas, and other organs, but it does not cause a diaphragmatic hernia. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is a lung abnormality that results in the formation of cysts, but it also does not involve a diaphragmatic hernia. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a condition that affects premature infants and is characterized by a lack of surfactant, a substance that helps the lungs expand, but it does not involve a diaphragmatic hernia. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can lead to lung disease but does not cause a diaphragmatic hernia.",b,b,TRUE,

[calcium gluconate does not shift potassium into cells or reduce its level but prevents its arrythmogenic effect on heart and buys time till definitive measures are taken].,"In this scenario, the correct answer for an effective treatment for the patient's hyperkalemia is b. calcium gluconate iv. This is because calcium gluconate does not shift potassium into cells or reduce its level, but it prevents the arrhythmogenic effect of potassium on the heart and buys time until definitive measures are taken. Calcium chloride iv (option a) may cause tissue necrosis and is typically reserved for severe hypocalcemia. Insulin subcutaneously (option c) is used in conjunction with glucose to shift potassium into cells, but this may cause hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients. Furosemide iv (option d) increases urinary potassium excretion but may not be effective in severe cases of hyperkalemia. Therefore, calcium gluconate iv is the best choice for this patient's hyperkalemia as it works quickly and effectively to prevent the harmful effects of potassium on the heart while other measures are taken to normalize potassium levels.",b,b,TRUE,

[ectopic testis is prone to develop testicular cancer and therefore it should be surgically removed].,"The correct answer in this case is c. orchidectomy. This is because an ectopic testis, as in the case of this 25-year-old man with a testis located in the abdomen, is prone to developing testicular cancer. Therefore, it is recommended that the testis be surgically removed rather than attempting a short trial of hcg, reassurance, or administering iv testosterone. Orchidopexy is a surgical procedure that may be appropriate in cases where the testis is not located in the abdomen but is not the best option in cases of an ectopic testis. It is important to remove the affected testis promptly to prevent the development of cancer and ensure the patient's long-term health.",c,c,TRUE,

[this is stress induced hyperglycemia and not always needs insulin. as dehydration can cause worsening of hyperglycemia our immediate treatment is iv fluid (though it is mild). later evaluation will be made whether insulin should be given or not].,"In this scenario, the most appropriate immediate treatment would be option B: IV fluids. The patient's increased blood glucose levels could be due to stress-induced hyperglycemia, which can worsen with dehydration. Therefore, it is crucial to rehydrate the patient with IV fluids to improve their hydration status and potentially stabilize their blood glucose levels. Insulin may not always be necessary for stress-induced hyperglycemia, and further evaluation can determine if it's needed. Option C suggests stopping dexamethasone, which may be necessary in certain situations but is not the most appropriate immediate treatment for the patient's symptoms. Option D suggests stopping sodium valproate and changing to another anti-epileptic, which also may be necessary but is not relevant to the patient's immediate treatment for thirst and dehydration.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because the blue patch is likely to be a harmless condition called Mongolian spot, which presents as macular blue-gray pigmentation usually on the sacral area of healthy infants. Mongolian spot is common in babies of mixed race and usually appears within the first weeks of life, requiring no intervention as it disappears spontaneously within 4 years or can persist for life. Hence, options b, c, and d (cbc, xr, plt count) are not necessary and not relevant to the diagnosis of Mongolian spot.",a,a,TRUE,

In A-Fib, fibrillatory F waves replace P waves, and R-R intervals are irregular. A-Flutter typically has a regular ventricular rhythm, and while SVT can cause a rapid ventricular response, it typically has a regular rhythm as well. Mobitz Type 1 2nd Degree Heart Block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped beat, which is not seen in this ECG. Sinus Tachycardia results in a narrow QRS complex but should have discernible P waves, which are absent in this patient's ECG.",a,a,TRUE,

[sawtoothlike waves and regular r-r interval are diagnostic of atrial flutter].,"The correct answer is b. Atrial flutter. This is because the ECG shows sawtooth-like waves and a regular r-r interval, which are diagnostic of atrial flutter. The QRS complex of 80ms and ventricular rate of 150bpm suggest that the flutter waves are conducting to the ventricles at a 2:1 ratio. Options a and e can be ruled out because a-fib would show irregularly irregular rhythm and sinus tachycardia would not have sawtooth waves. Option c, SVT, would not have a regular r-r interval and option d, Mobitz type 1 2nd degree heart block, would have progressively prolonged PR intervals before a blocked beat. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case is atrial flutter.",b,b,TRUE,

MRI and carotid doppler are not the best options as they take longer to perform and may not provide the necessary details to diagnose SAH. X-ray is not useful in diagnosing neurological conditions such as SAH, making it an inappropriate choice.

[this is an incomplete question and bmi is needed to decide whether biguanide or sulphonylurea be prescribed].,"When considering prescribing a medication for a 68-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, the recommended drug of choice would be biguanides, option A. Biguanides, such as metformin, are typically the first-line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes due to their effectiveness in reducing blood glucose levels, low risk of hypoglycemia, and low incidence of weight gain. Sulphonyl urea, option B, can be an option if metformin is not tolerated or is contraindicated, but they carry a higher risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Insulin, option C, is typically considered for patients who are unable to control their blood glucose levels with oral medications or those with more severe type 2 diabetes. Finally, lifestyle modifications, option D, should always be considered as they can improve overall diabetes management and may even eliminate the need for medication.

During a laparoscopic mesh repair for hernia, the trochar is typically inserted at the midpoint between the umbilicus and ischial spine. When the trochar is inserted it will pass through several layers of tissue before reaching its destination. The first layer is typically the skin, followed by the subcutaneous fat, the external and internal oblique muscles, and the transversalis fascia. The linea alba, rectus muscle, conjoint tendon, and inguinal ligament are not pierced during this procedure. The external and internal oblique muscles are pierced to allow access to the hernia site, where the mesh will be implanted.",d,d,TRUE,
1532. a 48yo man has intermittent left sided lower abdominal pain and feels generally unwell. he has lost his appetite and has lost weight. temp=38.3c and he has bp=190/100mmhg. what is the single inv most likely to lead to dx”?,a. colonoscopy,b. endomysial antibodies,c. fasting serum glucose conc,d. tft,e. us abdomen,,,,,,key: the key is e. us abdomen. [probable diagnosis is diverticulitis and preferred investigation from given list is us abdomen].,"Based on the symptoms described, the probable diagnosis for the 48-year-old man is diverticulitis. The preferred investigation from the given list is ultrasound of the abdomen (US abdomen) as it is the most appropriate test for diagnosing diverticulitis in this case. Colonoscopy would not be the best option as it examines the colon, not the affected area in the lower left abdomen. Endomysial antibodies are not relevant to this condition and fasting serum glucose concentration and TFT would not indicate diverticulitis. Therefore, US abdomen is the single investigation most likely to lead to a diagnosis of diverticulitis in this patient.",e,e,TRUE,
1533. a man with dm comes to the ed after he collapsed at home. his gcs=10. what should be the next initial inv for this man?,a. capillary blood sugar,b. mri head,c. ct head,d. serum electrolytes,,,,,,,key: the key is a. capillary blood sugar. [it may be either hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic coma which can be detected by checking capillary blood sugar].,"The correct initial investigation for a man with DM who has collapsed and has a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is a capillary blood sugar test (a). This is because hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic comas can cause altered consciousness and collapse, and checking the capillary blood sugar level can help determine if this is the cause. MRI head (b) and CT head (c) are not appropriate initial investigations for this presentation and may be ordered later based on the results of the initial assessment. Serum electrolyte (d) levels may also be checked later, but are not the most urgent investigation in this scenario. Therefore, option (a) is the best initial investigation to help determine the cause of the man's collapse.",a,a,TRUE,

Amyloidosis is a disorder in which there is a buildup of amyloid proteins in various organs and tissues in the body, leading to organomegaly, including swollen liver and spleen. Additionally, amyloidosis can cause sensory neuropathy and proteinuria, as seen in this patient. The biopsy results that showed amorphous homogenous substance which stained red with congo-red confirmed the presence of amyloid proteins. Therefore, the choices b, c, and e can be eliminated as they do not align with the patient's symptoms and presentations. DM retinopathy does not lead to organomegaly and sensory neuropathy as seen in this case, so it can also be ruled out, making d the definitive answer.",d,d,TRUE,

[urinary symptoms and hard prostate on pr suggests prostatic cancer for which psa should be done].,"In a 75-year-old man with urinary symptoms of hesitancy, frequency, and nocturia along with a large hard prostate on rectal examination, the most appropriate investigation to consider would be prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. A raised PSA level suggests prostatic cancer, which is possible with the clinical presentation described. The other choices, including CA 125, CA 153, CA 199, and CEA, are not relevant in this scenario as they are tumor markers for different types of cancers such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer respectively. Therefore, the correct answer is option E, PSA testing, as it is the most appropriate investigation in this clinical setting.",e,e,TRUE,

[during the first decade of life of cf patients, staphylococcus aureus and hemophilus influenzae are the most common bacteria isolated from the sputum, but in the second and third decade of life, pseudomonas aeruginosa is the prevalent bacteria].","The correct answer to this question is c. S. aureus. During the first decade of life of a CF patient, S. aureus and H. influenzae are the most common bacteria found in the sputum. However, as the patient enters the second and third decade of life, P. aeruginosa becomes the prevalent bacteria. In this case, since the patient is suffering from pneumonia, S. aureus is the most likely cause as it is commonly associated with respiratory infections. Option a and b, H. influenzae and Klebsiella, are also common respiratory pathogens in CF patients but are less likely to cause pneumonia. Option d, S. pneumoniae, is a less common organism in CF patients and is not usually associated with pneumonia in this population. Option e, P. aeruginosa, is more commonly associated with pneumonia in later stages of CF, not in the early stages. Thus, the correct answer is S. aureus based on the age of the patient and the type of infection.",c,c,TRUE,

The copper T (c) may worsen the menstrual bleeding, while the use of Depo Provera (e) may potentially cause weight gain and exacerbate migraines. UAE (d) is not a contraceptive method but a procedure used to treat uterine fibroids. The COCP (a) may also increase the risk of migraines and blood clots in an obese woman. Therefore, the best possible management for this particular patient would be the Mirena coil.",b,b,TRUE,

[scaphoid fracture is often missed in initial x-ray].,"The most likely diagnosis for a 2-year-old who fell on their outstretched hand and presents with pain at the base of their thumb, despite having no fracture indicated on an X-ray, is a scaphoid fracture. It is important to note that scaphoid fractures are often missed in initial X-rays, which could be the case in this situation. Options b and c are unlikely as the radius and fingers are not in close proximity to the base of the thumb, and option a is also less likely in a 2-year-old. Option e cannot be confirmed without further testing. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is a scaphoid fracture that should be further investigated and treated as appropriate.",d,d,TRUE,
"1539.  a pt was admitted with increased frequency of passing urine, increased thirst, weakness and muscle cramps. what is the most probable dx?",a. conn’s syndrome,b. cushing’s syndrome,c. pheochromocytoma,d. hyperthyroidism,e. hypoparathyroidism,,,,,,key: the key is a. conn’s syndrome. [there is hypokalemia in conn’s syndrome. increased frequency of passing urine and increased thirst are from nephrogenic di resulted from hypokalemia and hypokalemia also causes weakness and muscle cramps].,"Based on the symptoms presented by the patient, the most probable diagnosis is a. Conn's syndrome. This is because hypokalemia, a common symptom of Conn's syndrome, can lead to increased frequency of urination and thirst due to nephrogenic DI. Additionally, hypokalemia can cause weakness and muscle cramps which are also present in the patient's symptoms. Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism are less likely as they do not typically present with the same constellation of symptoms as Conn's syndrome, and do not typically cause hypokalemia. Therefore, the correct answer is a. Conn's syndrome.",a,a,TRUE,
"1540. a 69yo male presented with sudden onset of dysphagia. he is neither able to swallow liquid nor solid, he recently had a denture fitting. what is the most probable dx?",a. foreign body,b. plummer vinson syndrome,c. achalasia cardia,d. esophageal rupture,e. esophageal ca 1,,,,,,key: the key is a. foreign body. [sudden onset of dysphagia to both liquid and solid and recent history of fitting denture suggests foreign body (denture) in oesophagus].,"The most probable diagnosis for a 69-year-old male with sudden onset dysphagia to both liquid and solid and a recent history of fitting denture is a foreign body, specifically the denture in the oesophagus. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation and history. The other choices are less likely as they do not fit with the patient's symptoms and history. Plummer-Vinson syndrome is characterized by dysphagia due to a narrowed oesophagus and iron-deficiency anaemia. Achalasia cardia is a condition where the lower oesophageal sphincter cannot relax, making it difficult for food to enter the stomach. Esophageal rupture usually presents with a sudden onset of chest pain and respiratory distress caused by ingesting foreign bodies, whereas esophageal cancer typically progresses slowly with dysphagia being a late symptom. In summary, given the patient's presentation, history and the options provided, a foreign body, specifically the denture, is the most probable diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
1541. a 62yo man with chronic schizophrenia presents with a mask like face and involuntary pill rolling movement in both hands. he complains of chronic cough and forgetfulness. he is on long term antipsychotic meds. what is the single most likely dx?,a. shy drager syndrome,b. parkinsonism,c. huntington’s chorea,d. tardive dyskinesia,e. akathisia,,,,,,key: the key is b. parkinsonism. [antypsychotic drugs can cause parkinsonism].,"The correct answer is B, Parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications that can cause symptoms such as a mask-like face, trembling, stiffness, and slowed movements. The other choices are unlikely as Shy-Drager Syndrome involves autonomic dysfunction, Huntington's Chorea causes uncontrolled movements, Tardive Dyskinesia causes involuntary movements of the mouth and tongue, and Akathisia causes an inner feeling of restlessness. The chronic cough and forgetfulness reported by the patient are not specific to any of the other answer choices and are not useful in determining the correct diagnosis. Therefore, based on the given symptoms and the patient's medication history, Parkinsonism is the most likely diagnosis.",b,b,TRUE,

[probable subarachnoid hemorrhage. ct may not show any abnormality in early stage in some instances and in that case we shall do csf examination 12 hours later to see xanthochromia].,"In a 34-year-old female presenting with vomiting and an acute-onset occipital headache, with photophobia but no neck stiffness, a CT brain has come back normal. The most appropriate further management would be a CSF exam. This is because there is a probable subarachnoid hemorrhage that may not show up on the CT scan at this early stage. In some instances, even when there is a subarachnoid hemorrhage, CT scans can appear normal. Therefore, the CSF exam is necessary to check for xanthochromia. The other choices listed, including a repeat CT brain, cerebral angio, and MRI brain, are not as appropriate as they do not provide the necessary information to confirm or rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The correct course of action is to perform a CSF exam 12 hours after the initial CT scan to determine if a subarachnoid hemorrhage is present.",c,c,TRUE,
1543. a lady with post ileo-colectomy closure of stoma has a small 4cm swelling around the stoma. what is the most appropriate management of the swelling?,a. local exploration of swelling,b. exploratory laparotomy,c. open laparotomy and re-closure,d. abdominal binder,e. truss,f. laparotomy with mesh repair,,,,,key: the key is a. local exploration of swelling.,"The most appropriate management for the small 4cm swelling around the stoma in a lady with post ileo-colectomy closure of stoma is local exploration of the swelling. This means that the area around the swelling will be examined to determine the cause of the swelling and how best to manage it. Exploratory laparotomy, open laparotomy and re-closure, abdominal binder, truss, laparotomy with mesh repair are all unnecessary and inappropriate management options for a small swelling. Exploratory laparotomy and open laparotomy are both extensive surgical procedures that are not warranted for such a small swelling. The abdominal binder and truss are used to provide support for abdominal hernias and are not indicated for a swelling around the stoma. Laparotomy with mesh repair may be appropriate for larger or more severe hernias, but not for a small swelling. Therefore, local exploration of the swelling is the most appropriate management in this case.",a,a,TRUE,
1544. a 64yo woman has been brought by her son for psychiatric evaluation. she says that she has stopped living with her husband because she is convinced it is someone else posing to be him. what kind of delusions is she suffering from?,a. delusion of reference,b. delusion of control,c. delusion of guilt,d. delusion of persecution,e. delusion of doubles,,,,,,"key: the key is b. delusion of control. this is a wrong key! the correct key is e. delusion of doubles. [delusion of control is a false belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior. the delusion of doubles, is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise].","The correct answer to the question is e) delusion of doubles. This is because the woman in the scenario believes that her husband is actually someone else posing to be him. This is characteristic of the delusion of doubles, which is a rare disorder where a person believes that different people are actually a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The other answer choices are incorrect as they refer to different types of delusions. Delusion of reference is the belief that everyday events, objects, or behaviors of others have particular significance to the patient. Delusion of control is the belief that another person or external force controls one's thoughts or behavior. Delusion of guilt is the belief that one has committed a terrible, often imaginary, crime that deserves punishment. Delusion of persecution is the belief that one is being mistreated, harassed, or conspired against.",e,e,TRUE,

[om often can be a cause of intracranial extension leading to cerebral abscess or meningitis].,"The correct answer to this question is b. meningitis. This is the most likely diagnosis because the patient is presenting with symptoms such as headache, lethargy, sweating and shivering, which are commonly associated with meningitis. Additionally, the patient has a known history of otitis media (OM), which is an infection of the middle ear that can often lead to intracranial extension, causing cerebral abscess or meningitis. The other answer choices are unlikely as they do not fit with the given symptoms. Furuncle, for instance, is a localized skin infection that would present with a different set of symptoms entirely, while myringitis only affects the eardrum and would not cause the systemic symptoms seen here. Similarly, nasopharyngeal tumor and OM may potentially interfere with nasal breathing, but they do not cause the systemic symptoms that the patient is presenting with. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is meningitis due to the patient's history of OM and the specific symptoms that they are displaying at present.",b,b,TRUE,
1546. a 46yo woman has gained weight. she has sensitivity to cold. her pulse = regular at 50bpm and heart=enlarged.  what is the single most likely underlying mechanism for this condition,a. autoimmune,b. degenerative,c. congenital,d. infective,e. nutritional,,,,,,key: the key is e. nutritional. this is a wrong key. correct key is autoimmune hypothyroidism. [the most common cause of hypothyroidism in uk is autoimmune hypothyroidism. in developing countries it is often nutritional (iodine deficiency).the diagnosis is autoimmune hypothyroidism (in hypothyroidism heart is often gets enlarged)].,"The correct answer to the question is a. autoimmune hypothyroidism. This is because the symptoms described - weight gain, sensitivity to cold and an enlarged heart - are all consistent with hypothyroidism. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the UK and frequently presents with these symptoms. The other options - degenerative, congenital, infective and nutritional - are unlikely to be the cause, as they do not typically lead to the symptoms described. While nutritional hypothyroidism is common in developing countries, it is not likely in this case as the patient is in a developed country. Therefore, the most likely cause for this patient's symptoms is autoimmune hypothyroidism.",a,a,TRUE,
1547. a 70yo man presents with a punched out ulcer between his toes. he is a heavy drinker and smoker. exam: ulcer is yellow and the foot turns red when dangling off the bed. what is the single most likely dx?,a. arterial ischemia ulcer,b. malignancy,c. neuropathic ulcer,d. pressure ulcer,e. venous stasis ulcer,,,,,,key: the key is a. arterial ischemic ulcer.,"The correct answer for the most likely diagnosis in this case is A, arterial ischemic ulcer. Arterial ulcers are caused by decreased blood flow to the affected area, leading to tissue damage and eventually an ulcer. In this case, the patient's age, history of heavy drinking and smoking, and the appearance of the ulcer (punched-out, yellow) all suggest that arterial insufficiency is causing the ulcer. The redness of the foot when dangling off the bed is also a hallmark sign of arterial insufficiency. The other options, such as malignancy, neuropathic ulcer, pressure ulcer, and venous stasis ulcer, are all less likely given the patient's presentation. Overall, the clinical picture is consistent with an arterial ischemic ulcer, and this is the most likely diagnosis.",a,a,TRUE,
1548. a 65yo woman complains of a painful discharging ulcer above her ankle on the inner side of her left lower leg. exam: the base of the ulcer is red and covered by a yellow fibrous tissue. the border is irregular. the skin is tight. what is the single most likely dx?,a. arterial ischemia ulcer,b. malignancy,c. neuropathic ulcer,d. pressure ulcer,e. venous stasis ulcer,,,,,,key: the key is e. venous stasis ulcer. [some people with venous insufficiency develop stasis dermatitis. blood pools in the veins of the lower leg. fluid and blood cells leak out of the veins into the skin. it is usually seen above ankle and inner side of leg].,"The correct answer is e. Venous stasis ulcer. This is because the patient's presentation matches the classic manifestations of a venous stasis ulcer - a painful discharging ulcer above the ankle on the inner side of the lower leg with a red base, irregular border, and yellow fibrous tissue covering. Additionally, the patient's skin is tight, which can be indicative of venous insufficiency. Arterial ischemia ulcer would present with a different set of symptoms, such as pain in the foot that worsens with activity, a pale appearance, and a lack of pulse in the foot. Malignancy would likely present with other abnormalities besides just the ulcer, such as thickening or nodules in the skin. Neuropathic ulcers and pressure ulcers tend to occur in areas with decreased sensation or chronic pressure, respectively, and do not match the patient's presentation.",e,e,TRUE,

[post mi rupture of papillary muscl is responsible for valve failure (mitral regurgitation) causing pulmonary oedema and heart failure].,"The most probable cause of the 55-year-old woman's present condition of pulmonary edema and heart failure, which occurred five days after an acute MI, is ruptured papillary muscle. Post MI rupture of papillary muscle can lead to valve failure, causing mitral regurgitation, pulmonary edema, and heart failure. VSD, pericarditis, a-fib, and re-infarction are less likely to cause these specific symptoms. Therefore, choice A, C, D and E are not the correct answer. The correct answer is B - ruptured papillary muscle - as it is a known complication after an MI and consistent with the patient's symptoms.",b,b,TRUE,
1550. a 76yo woman presents with deep stroke 6h ago. what would the immediate tx be?,a. aspirin 75mg,b. aspirin 300mg,c. streptokinase,d. iv heparin,e. dipyridamole 200mg,,,,,,key: the key is b. aspirin 300mg.,"The immediate treatment for a 76-year-old woman who presents with a deep stroke 6 hours ago would be option B, aspirin 300mg. Aspirin is a thrombolytic agent that helps to prevent blood clots, which can cause further damage and complications in cases of stroke. Option A, aspirin 75mg, may not be strong enough to effectively treat the stroke. Option C, streptokinase, is a clot-busting medication that must be administered within four hours of the stroke, so it would not be effective at this point. Option D, IV heparin, is an anticoagulant used in some cases of stroke, but it carries significant risks and is not typically used as a first-line treatment. Option E, dipyridamole 200mg, is another antiplatelet drug that is sometimes used in combination with aspirin, but it is not usually the primary treatment for acute stroke. Therefore, option B, aspirin 300mg, is the best immediate treatment option for this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

[delusion of control is a false belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior].","The correct answer is a. control. The man is suffering from a delusion of control, where he falsely believes that his friend is causing his arm to move involuntarily. Control delusions involve a belief that an external force, person, or group of people is controlling one's thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior. Persecution delusions involve a belief that one is being targeted or persecuted, guilt delusions involve a belief that one has committed a terrible sin or wrongdoing, reference delusions involve feeling that random events are specifically related to oneself, and grandeur delusions involve believing that one has exceptional powers or abilities. Therefore, options b, c, d, and e are not relevant to the presented scenario.",a,a,TRUE,

This means that the gene mutation that causes this disorder is located on an autosome (non-sex chromosome) and is dominant, which means that if a person inherits one copy of the mutated gene, they will exhibit symptoms of the disorder. The other answer choices are incorrect because hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia does not exhibit incomplete penetrance, which is when someone has the gene mutation but does not show symptoms, and it is not autosomal co-dominant, meaning that both copies of the gene contribute equally to the phenotype. It is also not inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that two copies of the mutated gene would need to be inherited in order to exhibit symptoms. Overall, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the mutant gene to have the disorder.",d,d,TRUE,

[cortical blindness is the total or partial loss of vision in a normal-appearing eye caused by damage to the brain's occipital cortex.  rarely, a patient with acquired cortical blindness may have little or no insight that they have lost vision, a phenomenon known as anton–babinski syndrome].","The most likely defect in this case is e) cortical blindness, which is the total or partial loss of vision in a normal-appearing eye caused by damage to the brain's occipital cortex. In particular, due to damage in his occipital cortex, this man is unable to see his surroundings properly, which has also led to difficulty locating the door in his house. It is possible that he may not be aware of his loss of vision due to Anton-Babinski syndrome. The other options, including a) paracentral scotoma, b) tunnel vision, c) total blindness, and d) central scotoma, are not the most likely defects in this case.",e,e,TRUE,

[dysurea is suggestive of uti. uti also can lead to confusion. urine nitrates if positive is diagnostic of uti].,"The correct answer is b. Urine nitrates. The patient's presentation of dysuria and confusion strongly suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause various neurological symptoms in the elderly population. Urine nitrates if positive is a highly specific diagnostic test for UTI. Blood cultures may be useful if there is suspicion of sepsis, but they are not the initial investigation for UTI. A CT head and ECG are not indicated for dysuria and confusion in the absence of other symptoms. An intravenous urogram (IVU) may be useful in certain cases, but it is not the initial investigation for UTI. In summary, the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient is a urine nitrate test to confirm a diagnosis of UTI.",b,b,TRUE,

The features presented are consistent with esophageal candidiasis, which is a fungal infection. Oral fluconazole (200-400 mg daily) or IV fluconazole for 14-21 days are the preferred treatments for esophageal candidiasis. Option A, antispasmodics, are not effective in treating this condition. Option B, H2 blockers, are used to reduce stomach acid production and are not indicated for treating esophageal candidiasis. Option C, antibiotics, are not effective in treating fungal infections and may actually worsen the condition. Option E, I&D (incision and drainage) is not indicated in this case as esophageal candidiasis is a systemic condition and not a localized abscess. Therefore, antifungals are the most effective treatment for this patient's condition.",d,d,TRUE,

[as family is complete hysterectomy is the best option to stop bleeding and it also helps not to get endometrial carcinoma].,"The most appropriate management for this patient experiencing heavy periods and with a low hemoglobin level is hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is the best option as the patient has completed her family and it guarantees success in stopping the heavy bleeding. This option also reduces the risk of endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial ablation and hysteroscopic/laser resection of fibroids may not be effective in this case as the bleeding is heavy and constant. Myomectomy may not be appropriate as it is used to remove fibroids, but the patient's condition is not due to fibroids. UAE (Uterine artery embolization) is also not the appropriate choice for this patient as it is used to shrink fibroids and the patient does not have fibroids causing the bleeding. Therefore, hysterectomy is the most suitable option to manage menorrhagia in this patient.",b,b,TRUE,

[thioridazine and other antipsychotics (neuroleptics, dopaminergic antagonists) can cause degenerative retinopathies with histological, electrophysiological and symptomatological features similar to those of primary retinitis pigmentosa].","The correct answer to the question is a. thioridazine. Thioridazine, along with other antipsychotics, can cause a degenerative retinopathy that presents with similar symptoms to primary retinitis pigmentosa. The histological and electrophysiological features of this retinopathy are also similar to primary retinitis pigmentosa. Therefore, it is likely that the man's antipsychotic medication caused his retinitis pigmentosa-like symptoms.

This is indicated by the low MCV, angular stomatitis, red tongue, and koilonychia, which are all characteristic signs of iron deficiency anemia. Folate deficiency (a) can cause anemia, but it would not present with these specific symptoms. Similarly, B12 deficiency (b) can cause anemia and can also cause glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), but it would not typically present with angular stomatitis or koilonychia. Vitamin E deficiency (d) would not present with any of these symptoms. Hemolytic anemia (e) can cause low HGB, but the MCV would likely be high rather than low, and the characteristic signs would be different.

The symptoms described, such as sudden severe eye pain, a red eye, visual blurring, acuity of only finger counting, nausea, vomiting, and a shallow anterior chamber that is hazy on shining a torch, are all indicative of this condition. Acute closed angle glaucoma is caused by a rapid increase in intraocular pressure due to the blockage of the eye's drainage system, which can be a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. The other answer choices, such as a. crvo, c. uveitis, d. iritis, and e. open angle glaucoma, do not match the classic presentation of the symptoms described in the question.

The patient's symptoms and CXR findings suggest that they have a bacterial infection, possibly pneumonia, which requires a targeted antibiotic therapy. Amoxicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and penicillin are all antibiotics that are commonly used to treat bacterial infections, but they may not be effective against the specific bacteria causing the patient's illness. Clarithromycin, however, belongs to the class of macrolide antibiotics and has broad-spectrum coverage against a variety of bacterial pathogens, including those commonly found in respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Therefore, clarithromycin is the most suitable option for treating this patient's condition.

Dilatation of the LES. In this case, the patient has a lower esophageal ring which is causing dysphagia. Dilatation is the most appropriate treatment for this condition, as it can help to widen the ring and improve swallowing. Reassurance (a) is not appropriate as the patient is experiencing a physical obstruction. Antispasmodics (b) may help with spasms, but will not resolve the underlying problem. Endoscopic diverticulectomy (d) is a more invasive procedure and is not necessary in this case. I&D (e) is not relevant to this condition and is not a treatment option. Repeat esophageal dilation can be safely performed in patients with recurrent symptoms from rings and webs, and can provide long-term relief.",c,c,TRUE,

This swelling could be due to extravasation of blood and inflammation, which can be improved by elevating the affected hand in a high sling. This allows for a gravitational shift of fluid from the hand, thus reducing the swelling and inflammation. Using a splint or putting the hand in plaster may provide stability but will not address the swelling and inflammation. A broad arm sling or neighbor strapping would not be effective in reducing the swelling and promoting faster recovery. Therefore, the best course of action would be to elevate the hand in a high sling for 2 days.",d,d,TRUE,

SAD is a type of depression associated with late autumn and winter and thought to be caused by a lack of light. While options b, c, d, and e are possible diagnoses, they do not match the specific symptoms mentioned in the question. Major depression (b) typically involves symptoms that persist throughout the year, while dysthymia (c) is characterized by a chronic low mood that does not meet the criteria for major depression. Generalized anxiety disorder (d) involves excessive worry and anxiety, but not necessarily depression symptoms. Bipolar disorder (e) involves episodes of both depression and mania, which are not described in the question.

[arf and recurrent epistaxis and hemoptysis suggests wegener’s granulomatosis for which c anca is most specific].,"The correct answer is b. c anca. This is because the patient's symptoms of arf and recurrent epistaxis, as well as hemoptysis, suggest the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis which is typically associated with c anca positivity. P anca positivity is commonly seen in other autoimmune diseases such as microscopic polyangiitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Anti ro, anti ds DNA, and anti centromere antibodies are associated with other autoimmune diseases and are not typically seen in Wegener's granulomatosis. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and disease presentation, c anca is the most specific antibody for Wegener's granulomatosis.",b,b,TRUE,

This is because warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, has a delayed onset of action and can take several days to reach therapeutic levels, which can increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Heparin, on the other hand, has a faster onset of action and can be safely administered as a bridge therapy to prevent thromboembolism until the patient can be put back on warfarin postoperatively. Continuing warfarin, increasing its dose, or adding heparin can lead to increased bleeding risk, which is not desirable in a surgical setting. Therefore, stopping warfarin and starting heparin is the most appropriate preoperative measure to ensure patient safety.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the individual is experiencing low mood, loss of libido, tiredness, and suicidal intentions, which are all characteristic features of major depressive disorder. Bipolar affective disorder is unlikely as there is no mention of manic or hypomanic episodes. Dysthymia and recurrent brief depression are also unlikely as the individual's symptoms have lasted for at least 2 weeks. Schizoaffective disorder is also unlikely as there is no mention of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions. Therefore, the correct answer is c. major depressive disorder.",c,c,TRUE,

This is because the patient is experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, and reduced air entry at the left lung base, which are typical symptoms of pulmonary embolism. Additionally, her vital signs show an elevated heart rate and slightly elevated temperature, which are also commonly seen in cases of pulmonary embolism. The absence of wheezing and near normal temperature rules out aspiration pneumonia (A) and favours the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

Short Q-T interval. [Short Q-T interval secondary to a shortened ST segment].,that is correct! hypercalcemia can lead to a shortening of the q-t interval on ecg due to a shortened st segment. this is because calcium plays an important role in the repolarization of cardiac cells. a shortened q-t interval can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias. the other options are not typically associated with hypercalcemia. an increased qrs interval may be seen in conditions such as bundle branch block or ventricular hypertrophy. a prolonged q-t interval may be seen in conditions such as electrolyte abnormalities or certain medications. a short p-r interval may be seen in conditions such as wolff-parkinson-white syndrome.,d,d,TRUE,
